    "It is very common that the raw data isn't in the form that you need it. You need to figure out how to transform it into something usable for the statistics and/or visualizations that you want to produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, I'm going to take the goal of understanding collisions. Each row of the data represents a person, not a collision, so if we visualized or analyzed the raw data, we could be misled, as collisions with more people would receive more weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we need to do is to build a dataset of accidents, with datetime, weather, number injured, and number killed.\n",
    "\n",
    "My suspicion, based on what I've seen so far, is that all of these are the same across each of the rows for a given collision. It is worth testing that assumption, though.\n"
