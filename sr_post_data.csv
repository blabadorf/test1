CMV: Firing someone for their behaviour off-duty is unethical and should be illegal,"I hate bigots as much as the next person and understand the desire to track them down, tell their employers about their off-work racism and laugh as they get fired...it's satisfying af. But I also believe when we do this, we take advantage of an unethical system that works against everyone, including us.

Our employers already own and control us when we're at work. Why has it become accepted that they own and control our off-work lives too? People should be able to drink at a party and post risque photos without losing their job over it, provided their weekend debauchery doesn't hinder their performance. And yes, they should also be able to say whatever ugly racist shit they want off the clock. They should be punished by the law in places where that's illegal. But the workplace has no business inserting itself unless that behaviour has happened during work hours, on-premises or in work uniform. 

The argument that ""they're tarnishing their company by representing it poorly"" is BS. Nobody should be expected to represent their workplace 24/7 and if they are, their pay should reflect that.

Why is this legal and why are people okay with it?",2020-05-27 03:56:31,changemyview
"CMV: Automation is destroying life. Large corporations that enable the mass production, packaging, and transportation of essential items are doing more harm than good. Small, local shops should be encouraged instead.","People should avoid the idea of branded and packaged goods for common things like food, toiletries, and cleaning supplies as much as possible. Instead of transporting these necessities across long distances, local production should be supported. This would drop preservative and plastic use, reduce poverty and unemployment, and improve quality of life for people and nature.

Automation has boosted production, but I believe it causes the flow of wealth to funnel towards to fewer, fortunate people. It costs the community more of their wealth because if they had local producers that converted raw materials to equivalent and more natural goods, the community does not pay for transportation or the packing. Modern, first world communities should practice local and natural production.

Science has given us plastic, and plastic proves how useful it can be. But it is misused in the packaging of food and and toiletries. This malpractice is evident in the damages seen in documents of nature and wildlife.

I believe that if I could travel a mile or two from my neighborhood and pick up eggs, fruit, bread, soap, toothpaste, meats, and so on from multiple local vendors, the majority of people would live more successful and happier lives.",2020-05-27 03:29:27,changemyview
CMV: you shouldn't vote blue no matter what,"Actually you shouldn't vote a certain party no matter what, you should keep what I call a purple mentality, all candidates are innocent until proven to be shit

Now the honest truth is this, you can't have the government ran on one party alone or their views alone, this leads down a road where everything changes for the good at first for those who voted for them but then it goes downhill, there is a thing as too much liberalism and too much conservativism, there's needs to be balance

CMV: You can actually divide by 0,"Hello!

This is my first post here, i hope it won't get shadowbanned because my account is relatively new and doesn't have much karma. I also apologise for any mathematics terminology errors, English is not my first language.

Everyone knows ""dividing by 0"" problem. One common explanation is one which was popularised by apple assistant, Siri:

""Imagine that you have zero cookies and you split them evenly among zero friends. How many cookies does each person get? See? It doesn’t make sense. And Cookie Monster is sad that there are no cookies, and you are sad that you have no friends""

This take tries to simplify the problem by putting cookies as dividend and your friends as divider, arguing that you can't split x equal 0, by y that doesn't exist. There is one thing wrong with that take though, as you also can't by that logic split cookies (0 or not) between negative amount of friends. Even worse, there is no real life model for dividing by negative numbers (for example 10/-2), but you can actually explain how much cookies any of your not existent friends would get - if you have cookies, you could give each of your non existent friend an infinite amount. If you don't have cookies, i believe then that's 1 similiarly as with 0 power. If that is ""pure"" 0.

There are 2 things i want to mention.

1st is that math is often very abstract, and doesn't always model reality as whole.
Examples are dividing by negative numbers, x to 0 power is 1, negative powers, 0,(9) = 1, imaginary and complex numbers, hyperreal numbers etc.

2nd is, that same as 0 isn't actually real, ∞ is not too, and based on functions and limits i think that:

x/0 is x*∞. And x ∞ is infinity increasing x times, for example 2 ∞ is function f(x)=2x so basically 2,4,8 without end, instead of 1,2,3 without end

0/0 is equal to 0*∞ which is 1

Now how to explain things like 2*0/0? I think it's rather simple. Same as there are different infinities (increasing at different time), there are 'different nulls'. I think 0 has memory. Let's test it. To solve example above, first multiply 2*0. You get 0, but remember it came from 2. If you divide it by 0, you get 2 back.

10∞*0=10=10*0*∞

If we assume both 0s and infinities have 'memory', now it is possible

CMV: Choosing to be a teenage parent is irresponsible.,"I think it's been pretty well established at this point that children raised by teen parents are worse off in life. There are plenty of studies showing that children raised by teenaged parents have higher risks for health problems as infants, low IQs, and even becoming  teenage parents themselves. 

Personally, I think that pregnant teenagers should be able to get an abortion if they want to, or they should put the baby up for adoption, whether that be through an agency or to another family member. I do not, however, support a child being allowed to care for a baby. Most kids under 18 are not emotionally, financially, or mentally prepared to raise a child effectively.

I sympathize with teens who can't get an abortion for whatever reason, or for those who deal with emotional pain from putting their child up for adoption, but I think actively choosing to raise a baby as a child is an irresponsible decision that teens should not be legally allowed to make. I think they should have to prove a plan of action for after the baby's birth, such as arranging an adoption or letting the child be raised by a family member, and if they fail to do so the baby should be automatically taken into the custody of the state.

 I know there are some teen parents who turn out fine, but those really seem to be the exception to the rule and I don't see why anyone should get to gamble with the future of a child because of their own desires at a young age.",2020-05-27 02:12:47,changemyview
CMV: Feminism is mostly fraudulent at this point and Men’s issues don’t get nearly enough attention and that needs to change.,"I tried posting with sources before and the links didn’t work, you’re welcome to fact check my claims and prove me wrong.

 -Men have higher rates of suicide, particularly in teenagers and young adults

-Colleges and companies frequently higher women over men simply for diversity

-Men make up an astounding percentage of military and workplace deaths

-Men are far more often the victims of violent crime (excluding rape and sexual assault) 

-Men are graded harsher than women in schools and jobs

-Men are held to more of a double standard than women are

-Men’s problems are frequently silenced by feminists, while MRA’s almost never do the same

-Men and men’s issues are often laughed at by society and never given a spotlight

-Men are frequently falsely accused of rape and get their lives ruined without a trial

-Most people view actual equality as mysoginistic

-Pop culture always displays men as bumbling children and women as intelligent masters

-Society is okay with suppression of Men’s Rights activists and men themselves but never suppression of women

-Male victims of rape are often excused because ‘There must be an insertion of something into their body’

-Men are treated harsher under the law

-Men have much higher and longer incarceration rates

CMV: Armed uprising is the only way to deal with the US' police issue,"Yet another man senselessly killed by the police. These police officers were being recorded and had onlookers pleaded with them as one cop dug his knee into the back of neck of a downed man. He wasn't responsive and the cop continued to press down on him until he died. All the other cops either helped pin him down or just watch. In a just world, this man could have been saved by armed bystanders killing these cops. 

The bystanders at the scene were completely helpless, and were even threatened with mace when they tried to intervene and save this man's life. And these cops knew that they were not going to be held accountable. They did all this while being filmed. They know the system is on their side. Yes, I knew they were fired. They'll get off on any manslaughter charges and be working again in a different county once everything blows over.

The fact of the matter is that cops need to be afraid of doing stuff like this. Public outrage ain't cutting it. They don't give a fuck. The police unions don't care. The DAs don't care. And there just isn't the political will to force any change because most of this is happening in minority communities who don't have the political power to make any changes. 

This leads me to believe that American civilians need to stand together and arm ourselves. So when cops start doing things like this, they'll be afraid of being killed in the middle of doing it. It's really harsh, but that's how self defense works. I feel like minority communities need to arm themselves against the police and slowly force them out of their neighborhoods. This is really the only option left. Nothing is going to change unless a change is forced via threat of violence. 

There's obviously a ton of downsides to this and I don't think it's pretty. But I'm starting to think it's the only option left.",2020-05-27 01:31:22,changemyview
CMV: Employers should be allowed to select against strong accents when hiring for communication-heavy roles,"When hiring for specific positions, particularly ones with a high degree of spoken interpersonal communication, employers should be allowed to filter candidates based on their accent.

For most listeners, a speaker’s accent forms part of how you perceive what they are saying and  your comprehension of their ideas. If someone has heavily accented speech, relative to the local dialect, customers and co-workers have great difficulty when interacting. If you’re working in a call center role and the customer can’t understand half of what you’re saying, then you won’t be an effective worker, even if on paper everything else is great. Customers could be negatively impacted and your business could suffer all because you couldn’t filter this worker during the hiring process. 

As soon as people hear this opinion, they immediately go to “racist”, but I beg to differ. My opinion applies equally regardless of your skin colour. If you work in Montreal with a deep southern accent that makes you frequently intelligible to the location population, then it would apply in that situation as well. It is up to the firm to decides when an accent becomes an impediment for the given role.

Yes, this would give employers the ability to filter out candidates for certain roles in a grey area where verbal plays a smaller part and does not impede performance in the role. This is a problem; however, I will argue that market forces will deal with these employers in the long run. If you consistently reject quality employees for slightly accented speech in roles where it doesn't matter, then the market will push these high-value employees to competitors.

However, to provide some recourse in the short-term, I would expect the law permitting this behaviour to be defined to the “reasonable” standard. If the position reasonably requires a worker  without an accent that impedes their speech, then it would be valid to select based on that. If you’re hiring for an email-based customer service rep, then the employer would not be allowed to use accent as a filtering criteria. Candidates rejected for accented speech in a role that doesn't justify it could sue for compensation. A judge/jury (depending on local legal system) would determine what is reasonable. It would be up to the employer to determine whether they want to risk adjudication for roles that are in a grey area.",2020-05-27 00:40:43,changemyview

CMV: The modern Education System hasn't changed as much as it should have since the 1800s,"We invented what we know today as the modern education system in the 1800s to teach young children how to work in factories and do neat, orderly work without stopping for about 8 hours. We made a system that didn't categorise anyone based on needs and intelligence, everyone starts and ends at the same place regardless of the fact that intelligence varies hugely between people. 

Today our system has obviously changed to suit a more broad range of skills to assist in finding a job later in life. If this is the goal, then we have failed. No where do we learn about politics, personal finance, investing, social media, computer science, coding, web design, starting a business, raising a family, international affairs, the news, self defence, controlling anger and using methods like meditation, the best ways to exercise, healthy eating, I could go on. Instead we learn algebra, geology, chemistry, history, English and so on. Aside from completely missing the mark when it comes to what to teach our children, school takes up way to much time. Children should come home and be done with school for the day without having to deal with homework.

I also can't write a post like this without mentioning exams. Research has shown that asking someone to memorize huge amounts of information across 3 or 4 years and then asked them to repeat this information in small, random amounts onto a page in 3 hours is the worst method of teaching. In Ireland where I am from people enter what is called Primary school from ages 3-5 and attend primary school until the age of 12-13. Then they go on to Secondary School for 6 years from 12 up until they are around 18. When the student is 15 they do what is called the Junior Certificate or Junior Cert. They memorize *not learn* everything over those three years and take a huge test in every subject then at 18, after another three years they do the same again. This is such an inefficient system.

My last arguement is the lack of technology used effectively to teach and connect teachers and students to increase the effectiveness of education but I'm pretty sure everyone knows what I'll say on that one so I'll leave it there as I've written a 200 book already :)",2020-05-27 00:09:51,changemyview
CMV: -ists and -phobes should watch more television,"Rational human beings know by now that there is zero reason to be racist, sexist, or any kind of phobe. Literally any amount of time spent with people who look or act differently than you shows that, shocker, they're just people who generally want the same things. Not to get killed for no reason. Food and shelter. The ability to do what they want especially when that activity affects not a single other person. And no one in their right mind wouldn't be upset if these normal human desires were blocked. I think that one way to stop the idiots who don't get this is with television.

Hear me out. There's been a ton of research that shows that what you watch affects you. If you watch a lot of Top Gear, you probably like cars, but you also learn about cars or the places traveled to in the show. This deepens when you look at portrayals of people. If you watch television with solid, non-jokey representation, you are less likely to hate or fear the people represented. If you identify with a tv character, you are much less likely to hate on people who look like them in real life.

Here's one study done on homophobia before and after watching just one movie: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323187487\_Positive\_Representation\_of\_Gay\_Characters\_in\_Movies\_for\_Reducing\_Homophobia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323187487_Positive_Representation_of_Gay_Characters_in_Movies_for_Reducing_Homophobia)

The study shows that people came out of the movie more likely to identify across sexualities and less likely to engage in rhetoric or actions that would be classified as homophobic.

Watching television featuring people who look and act different than you enables you to identify and understand people who look and act differently. So the solution to the stupidity that is racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia or any of that is to make them watch television with good representation. Which shows have good representation? Look it up, dummy!

Blacks scare you? You're dumb, but watch more tv (Insecure, Black-Ish, Atlanta, Empire)

Don't understand why your sexist jokes keep getting you reported to HR? You're dumb, but watch more tv (Fleabag, Big, Little Lies, Insecure again)

"CMV: If you believe that some people such as drug addicts, should not have kids, then you shouldn't call people who think poor people shouldn't have kids 'monsters'","I guess my view is, I don't see how it makes you a monster for saying that poor people, as in, for example, people in africa who walk miles just to find water, who are starving to voluntarily have kids. Even your average poor american. 

If your reasoning that drug addicts should not have kids is because you believe that the kids will be harmed, and as long as people's reasoning are the same, then why are they any different? many who say the poor shouldn't have kids believe a kid is better off not existing than existing. If you say 'existence' is better than non existence, than the same would apply to drug addicts. 

I guess I just can't see why for some reason when we add economics into it, everything becomes taboo.

Majority of people are ok saying pedophiles should not have kids. But somehow people believe that even the poor are entitled to have kids? Now, I believe that just because someone has a different standard does not mean that they are monsters. I might have a low standard, but someone having a higher standard are not monsters. 

Most of us will also agree that at a certain age, kids, as in teens should not be having kids. If I say well I don't think 16 year olds and under should be having kids, but you say that I don't think 20 and under should be having kids, does that make you a monster because your standard is 'more than mine'

"CMV: If you can inherit a house, you should be able to inherit sins","When it comes to slavery and reparations I've heard far too many times from people that they shouldn't be forced to pay or be punished for an action they directly didn't contribute to. They should not be forced to pay reparations to african americans due to the actions of their ancestors. It makes perfect sense to me, if they did not contribute to an outcome they don't deserve whatever the consequences that outcome may produce..

&amp;#x200B;

However, in such a hypocritical fashion. these very same people feel entitled to the achievements their ancestors have made. They have no issues accepting the benefits of their ancestors, houses being passed down into the family, businesses, wealth of any sort. Countless people continue on to this day reaping the rewards of the actions their family and ancestors have done, while having contributed nothing to its outcome. Merely by existing and being blood related they feel as if it is their birth right to gain such rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this not hypocrisy? Why is it that you cannot gain the sins and wrongful doing of your ancestors but you most certainly can gain the good from them? Material wealth is not the only way, were you to judge the son of a murderer you'd be called ignorant, a bigot, a fool. But of course, the son is his own man he committed no crimes he doesn't deserve any prejudice against him. Yet when you turn it around, when you have the son of someone famous and much loved, then you are praised and worshiped for that fact alone. You're no longer your own man, but your fathers son one who is loved and viewed highly due to the achievements of your parents, and thanks to nepotism you will easily find yourself with no locked doors as you progress in life.

&amp;#x200B;

If we are to allow people to be entitled of their ancestors positive achievements and wealth then it has to be both ways. If you can inherit your parents wealth then you too should be liable to inherit their sins. If your parents go to prison and failed to finish their sentence for whatever reason, dying to age, suicide or other complications than their sons or daughters or whatever other relative should be next in line to take their spot to finish it for them.

CMV: Using a food container that has been peed in and then washed is no less sanitary than using one that has had food in it and been washed,"Context: [this AITA thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gqpb4t/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_boyfriend_for_peeing/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

This isn’t about that post. I’m not arguing the GF is the asshole. This is just about how sanitary it is. 

I’m not going to make it specific to Tupperware. I’m talking about any normal food containers or utensils that are typically washed and reused for different types of food or drink. Plates, bowls, glasses, Tupperware, silverware, a plastic water bottle. 

I’m not talking about any type of container or item that’s generally used for only one type of food or drink, like a coffee thermos, protein shaker, etc. 

My view is pretty simple:

• Most food items are harder to clean out of a container than pee is. Pee is a liquid. Food can be sticky, it can dry on to surfaces, it can sometimes require scrubbing to clean fully.

• If you wash your dishes/containers/utensils well enough that you have no sanitation related concerns about the food that was in/on it before, then there’s no objective reason to be concerned that pee would be any different. 

• if you don’t wash your dishes/containers/utensils well enough to sanitize them after having been having been peed on, you probably aren’t washing them well enough in general and you should be more concerned they may not be sanitary because of the food that was in them than you should because of the pee. 

• The concerns people have about using dishes/containers/etc. that have been peed on and then washed are emotional or societal in origin and not related to any objective concerns about how sanitary the item would be after washing.",2020-05-26 22:34:11,changemyview
"CMV: It’s Hypocritical to want to deport Undocumented People for “Breaking the Law”, When the US Governemnt has a long History of Doing the Same to Them.","The US Government has a long history of blantly violating its own laws and agreements in order to harm Latino people. That is why I belive it’s wrong to chastise undocumented people for “breaking the law” when the law is ignored when it benefits people like them. How can you expect people to respect the law, when the US government has refused to do the same?  I’ve listed a few examples down below.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed by the US and Mexico after the annexation of Texas. One of the things it did was promising Mexican citizens living in Texas the right to thier religion, language, and land. However, this treaty was constantly violated, and many Mexican citizens were ran out of town by lynch mobs. These lynch mobs faced no opposition or punishment from the government. Federal authorities even stole their land, and then went on to redistributed it to white settlers in the region.

Operation Wetback, (Yes, that was it was literally called) was a deportation program in 1954 that removed thousands of LEGAL Mexican immigrants and even American citizens. They didn’t even get to have a trial to argue their cases, and were forced to leave beyond their property and possessions without any recourse. Most of those people were here due to the Brancero Program, which basically recruited Mexican immigrants to come to the US to keep food production running during WWII. Or in other words, the United States Government promised thousands of immigrants they could permantely stay in the country, if they immigrated at this time. But the second they stopped being useful, this promise was completely thrown away.

There are countless other examples (like the Zoot Suit Riots and Delano Grape Strike), but I don’t want this post to be too long.  **So in conclusion, I just don’t see how it’s fair to chastise undocumented people for violating the law, when the US government is more than happy to do the same when it involves them. **",2020-05-26 21:57:57,changemyview

CMV: Hating men is much more popularized thanks to feminism," So before I begin this, I just want to say, some men deserve to be hated and feminism isn't all that bad. I'm speaking from a view where I see a lot of SJW and extremist feminists around me and on my social media.

Feminism is probably one of the biggest movements at least in our modern-day society that you can't really run from unless you void yourself from society. Everywhere it's support women this, support women that, don't hate on any kind of women nonsense. Ofc I agree, I am a woman and I believe in equal rights for the genders which is supposed to be what feminism is about, equality.

Yet, it's straying so much into women deserve to be put on a higher pedestal than men and also, they can say things about men that men can't say about them. I can be scrolling on any kind of social media and see posts and/or comments from women saying, ""oh all men should be cast away on an island far away from us"", and literally this exact one that I'm copy and pasting, "" it's actually insane that men think anyone cares about their own specific personal opinion, like these are the exact things that im constantly sexualised for lmfao but he's so confident making this blanket statement? no one cares Don"". That last comment was in response to a post she saw of some guy posting on like Craigslist or smth lf a woman.

If a man made that comment about a woman, he would be ripped to shreds. ""Well, not all women are like that!"", ""how could you say that!"", ""sexist pig, misogynistic!"". The list could go on and on. I'm not saying all people who consider themselves feminists act this way but it's becoming way more prevalent. Since when is it ok to treat men the way women don't want to be treated?

I want to like the movement of feminism but I've found it to be extremely contradictory. CMV?",2020-05-26 20:41:36,changemyview
Cmv: USA is an utopia for powerful (through money or office) and mostly white people. Everyone else is just feed into grinder. US is propped by pure short term monetary benefit and materialism. The Poor Americans support it because they imagine themselves to be part of that group.,"Anyone one else who even says otherwise (the otherwise doesn’t even need to be right or wrong) are vilified either through propaganda or just plain bullying by not only the rich but also fellow class people (whatever class they belong to)

Three aspects make this view through observations and my time in different countries:

- Its always about money and benefit (sometimes even implied) in US society (again not comparing to any other). Everything is and can be measured in dollars and people are obnoxiously obsessed about their resources - case in point people showing off wads of cash in pictures as means to show affluence. Credit card culture. Loudest person about their affluence is considered the most successful irrespective of their “actual” success. People are purely judged and respected on their value extraction

- while every society has issues, being called poor in US is like an insult worse than racism , cancer or anything else. I mean yes being poor is not ideal but being ultra rich is also not necessary. Actual poor people in US seem to go to great extent to prove how they are not poor. While I understand where they are coming from but dont understand why?

- Any person who wants to do anything different or tries something different is just straight up bullied by everyone else. Bernie Sanders, That girl who spoke in UN (she is a kid for god sake) - just some examples from pop culture. Best example I can think of is Trumf - even from a “conservative” point of view surely there are better qualified  candidates who may be more staunch and more in tune with conservative philosophy. But somehow he earns their trust while never having done anything for them to earn so. I just don’t understand.",2020-05-26 20:28:39,changemyview
CMV: BDSM is abuse and self harm by proxy,"*note that this isn’t for all kinks, just kinks that are characterized by pain, punishment, humiliation/degradation, and extreme power dynamics

**Ive had this debate several times before and the main arguments I receive is “as long as there’s consent,” “you’re kink shaming,” or “let people do what makes them happy”. But I’m not arguing about what legal or consensual, I’m talking about what is psychologically healthy. Just like someone saying “talking to your abusive ex isn’t healthy” or “drinking too much Coca Cola isn’t good for you”

BDSM is literally abuse (physical and mental, sexual as well especially when involving “rape play”). It’s supposedly normal or at least common to cry and have panic attacks/anxiety during or after your session (sub drop), and it’s okay as long as your Dom/master comforts you, cuddles you, and puts lotion and stuff on your bruises.

That’s literally the abuse cycle. You’re literally mimicking the abuse cycle (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_of_abuse). Being violent and degrading then “undoing” it through affection, care, and consolation. Its literally called “aftercare”. It’s addictive and intoxicating, especially for someone vulnerable. Leaving a relationship that has elements of the abuse cycle is even more emotionally confusing than normal.

Of course I’m not saying people in BDSM are as bad as abusers who purposely terrorize their victims without consent. Of course most aren’t like this. Im saying that they are misinformed, and experiencing this addictive, toxic cycle without even realizing it. Whether or not you consent, fear is fear. Anxiety is anxiety. Depression is depression. If you’re feeling these things, your body is trying to tell you something. It shouldn’t be normalized as “just sub drop”. 

Your logical brain may tell you “it’s okay you consented, Brad is just hitting you and pining you down because you’re kinky”. But who knows what your more primal brain is thinking? The impact of being hit by someone else on your psyche? The connection made between this person you’re supposed to love and literal violence? (kinda unrelated but The Body Keeps The Score is an interesting book on how intertwined the brain and body is and how things like abuse and being molested can have physiological changes to your body and brain)

The bedroom isn’t some magical place where everything is healthy as long as there’s consent. Consent is imperative for any sexual act, but consent does not always mean it’s okay or healthy. Personally, even when I wasn’t too depressed or anxious, I enjoyed cutting, burning, and hitting myself to cause bruises and red marks on my legs. It made me feel a bit euphoric and calm. I loved looking at bruises and marks and caring for them with ointment.

It was consensual but it was 100% unhealthy, even though it didn’t cause lasting damage or health problems. Why? Because people shouldn’t hurt themselves. People shouldn’t let others hurt them either, and it doesn’t suddenly become okay because sex is involved.

I think a lot of people especially young girls forget to view this situation from a “master” or “dominant” perspective. It’s one thing to fantasize about that power dynamic from a submissive’s point of view, but to pursue that dynamic in real life requires finding a dominant who literally gets sexually excited by your suffering. That in itself is the biggest red flag that when observed on its own, would make any person run.

Not to mention the fact that even supposedly “healthy” BDSM requires a near perfect partner who will listen to everything you say, comfort you to an extreme degree, treat you like a queen when he isn’t pretending to rape you, etc. Of course these are things we should expect from all partners, but let’s be practical. There’s a chance that someone who conflates intimacy with pain, can keep an erection while seeing you startled/in pain, enjoys degrading you sexually, and repeatedly gets off on shows of extreme dominance will have issues in relationships. For BDSM relationships, it can be especially deadly: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/uk-england-essex-50468890

BDSM is not even done by mentally stable individuals all the time. When I wrote in a forum about my depression following my rape and sexual trauma (it wasn’t even BDSM related), I was approached in my messages by several Doms who wanted to Dom me for my own good, and that it would help me release my emotions and that their degrading “rules” would help me find structure in my life.

Some may view this as an isolated incident, but a quick look at BDSM related subreddits, websites, and forums would see that it’s not uncommon for those suffering from trauma, anxiety, and various mental illnesses to enjoy BDSM relationships. I even saw many popular posts about Doms initiating particularly “intense” scenes when their submissive was feeling particularly anxious, depressed, etc. 

Lastly, our thoughts and especially our actions don’t exist in a vacuum. You can’t 100% separate your work life from your life, your sex life from your life, because this IS a part of your life, especially if it’s something as emotionally intense as a BDSM relationship. The highs and lows of emotion and degradation can possibly impact how you view yourself, your inner dialogue, and how you view the world. Some don’t even try to hide this; they do 24/7 BDSM relationships which just seems like indentured sex servitude. This becomes even crazier when the couple has children, or when the nature of the relationship is like that outside.

So basically, yea. I’m just scared this stuff is being normalized and even promoted to teens (cough cough Seventeen magazine). And before someone says “I do BDSM and I’m happy” or “my Dom is a nice guy and never hurt me”. I’m genuinely happy for you. There’s people with different situations. I know a guy who used heroin a few times and escaped unscathed and not addicted. He said it felt great but didn’t want to become a junkie. But it shouldn’t been seen as normal",2020-05-26 20:26:25,changemyview
CMV: Overweight people (and other self-harming people) should pay way more for health insurance,"Let me start by stating that I'm one of those maximum liberals as in: Do whatever the F you want unless you're violating with the rights of someone else. Even if you choose to harm yourself in whatever way (smoking, drinking, you name it), I don't care much since it's your body; Just don't cry about it afterwards. The single only exception are children as they are not completely capable to understand the consequences of their behavior (which we might agree on). Everyone else should choose to do whatever they want, within the obvious boundary. This is an important premise for this topic because, if you choose to be overweight, smoke or whatever I'm 100% fine with it and even consider it your right to choose this.

However, this is leading me to the actual view: All unhealthy behavior should be result in higher insurance rates for those conducting them.  Now, obvious I'm used to having a health care insurance as it is standard in Germany for decades, which I consider a good thing. But it's exactly that: an insurance.  The fundamental idea beyond that is to regularly pay a certain amount in order to have lower costs in case the insured event occurs. That is if I insure my home and it happens to burn down the insurance covers the costs (depending on the details obviously). The amount to be paid is depending on how high the risk of the event is and how high the damage (-&gt; Cost) is if the insured happens. So, someone who has regular car accidents would have to pay more than someone who hasn't had an accident in decades; and someone driving a Ferrari would have to pay more than someone driving a Skoda. This makes sense as the risk which results of the actions of the insured person defines the amount the insurance demands. Now, obviously it's a simplification and there are a lot more details to it, but in general the principle applies.

Weirdly, the only factor determining the general health insurance in Germany and many other countries is the income. Which lacks any reason. There is no reason to suggest that people with higher income have a higher risk in needing a doctor; even worse: statistical evidence regularly show that higher income correlates with better health. While the latter has an explanation on what causes this correlation, I'm not arguing that lower income should lead to higher health insurance rates, but that income should not play any role in it whatsoever. But there are so many people smoking, drinking and being overweight (and so on) which are all scientifically proven to increase health risks tremendously. Yet, they pay the same amount as someone with the same income who eats healthy, runs marathons, and never smokes or drinks. Sure, the second one can become ill to and even serious illnesses because the risk is never 0%, but it is far less likely. At this point, I want to emphasize that I refer solely that BEHAVIOR should be considered.  Genetic predisposition is out of the person's sphere of influence but to smoke or not to smoke is a decision. So is drinking or not drinking; and so is being overweight or not. In my experience at least some people would agree with smoking and even some with drinking, but everyone would argue that being overweight ""is an illness"". Well, so is a smoker's lung but it is self-induced and willingly. And if a smoker gets lung cancer we would rightfully ask: ""What else did you expect?"". There is no illness which causes one to become overweight if one is not eating too much, while eating healthy is another thing. That's just plain physics. 

A health insurance should solely rely on how much risk someone putting to their health. I literally, don't see any reason against such an approach. For me it's just the very definition of an insurance. Yes, a lot of people wouldn't be able to afford their insurance given their current lifestyle, which means they would have to change it. However, right now those people already life on cost of others. We would only have to compromise on its implementation, as it is not detectable whether someone smoked once or not. But if someone is a regular smoker or drinker is detectable. So is, obvious, overweight. The list goes on for so many unhealthy behaviors with only few exceptions. And again, I can't emphasize enough that I only refer to behavior not non-behavioral aspects (genetics etc.). It just don't seem fair that people have to pay more health insurance solely because they make more money, while (as statistics suggests) may \[or may not\] behave healthier. This also does not conflict with my statement to do whatever the F you want with your body, since I do not want to keep you from doing it, I just demand that you take responsibility on your own actions and decisions.

Somehow, I barely find support for this, therefore give me those counterarguments; I might become enlightened. ;)",2020-05-26 20:10:10,changemyview
CMV: You can't learn much from fiction books,"I used to love reading fiction books when I was a kid, but at that time I didn't even know I could enjoy or understand books from other genres. 

Once I've discovered non-fiction books, I feel that I can finally see palpable results after reading: improved general knowledge, improved knowledge on a certain topic, ability to make connections between what I know and what I've just found out. The amount of information is huge, so there are very high chances that even someone with poor working memory would be left with something useful to keep in mind. 

It's not the same story when it comes to fiction books. I don't want to say that reading such a genre is a complete waste of time, but it's nothing more than a way of relaxing and that's all. I know, some of you would say that some classics will teach you moral values, but I don't see how a book is able to do that.

CMV: The environmental movement is elitist and tone-deaf to the needs of working class people.,"Climate change and its associated impacts present major threats to global biodiversity, major ecosystems and human life. 

The current environmental movement has been led by the middle-class with the free time and resources available to change their lifestyles to afford expensive, ""eco"" alternatives. I look at Extinction Rebellion when they were protesting in Westminster and I remember being accosted by several well-to-do women who seemed offended that I didn't want to engage as I had to go to work. ExR were criticised for being too white; I criticise them for being too middle class. 

Policy has not deviated from this. The low emission zones of London shame those who cannot afford cleaner vehicles. Pushes for green-washed brands shame those who cannot afford the exorbitant price tags. 

The movement as it currently stands is primarily to soothe middle class egos and, as a byproduct, shames the working class.

CMV: being anti-gun is not in line with the liberal mindset,"Premise: I consider myself a liberal, meaning that in the vast majority of cases I value personal freedom above traditional values. I also share with most liberal-oriented people the view that guns should be heavily regulated, or even completely banned. (I live in Europe, so for me this is mostly a thought exercise rather than a point of political debate).

Now, before you delete my post for breaking rule #2, let me explain. I DO believe my thesis: being anti-gun is NOT in line with the liberal mindset. Anti gun laws are a violation of personal freedom in favour of personal safety, which is the opposite of what liberals usually stand for (think about privacy, for example). 
Somehow this aspect rarely addressed, and from what I've seen, the discussions often revolve around wether guns are as dangerous as we percieve them to be. Well, of course they are, duh. But so are a lot of other things. 

Take alcohol for example. On its own it's fine, but it's dangerous because people have a tendency to drink while driving. And yet very few people want to ban alcohol: rather, we spread information and encourage people to be responsible. Personally I don't drink, but I'm fine with the idea that other people do. I just trust them not to drive afterwards.
Guns similarly are not dangerous on their own (when used for hunting, or even when kept for personal defense, if the right precautions are taken). But rather that empowering people to do the right thing and entrust them with this responsibility, we opt for outright banning firearms.

My thesis is that most liberals (myself included) are holding a stance that's impossible to defend without going against their own values. Please CMV, so I can stop feeling like an hypocrite whenever I think about this topic.",2020-05-26 18:16:49,changemyview

CMV: Free countries should give open immigration rights to Hongkongers.,"Given the progressively deteriorating human rights situation in Hong Kong, I think it would be beneficial in both a humanitarian and long-term national interest manner for free countries to open their borders to Hongkongers as refugees.

The humanitarian argument is the easiest one to make - it is obviously beneficial to people to give them more choice in where to live.  I am not saying anyone should be forced to leave Hong Kong.  Rather, there should be an option for those who want to leave.

I think as far as national interest for free countries, there are two dimensions on which this policy is beneficial.

First, it provides a means of checking Chinese power via a passive policy choice.  It is not a hostile act to grant visas, and the PRC government can't retaliate in kind because a free country doesn't see a right or ability to emigrate as a threat in the way a totalitarian state does.  It is a non-violent and non-escalatory means by which free countries can actually ""do something"" about the Hong Kong situation.

Second, in the long run attracting freedom-seeking people from a vibrant market economy is extremely economically beneficial.  The sort of people who will self-select to emegrate from Hong Kong given the opportunity are likely to be especially entrepreneurial and ambitious and valuable contributors to the society where they move.

I think the most obvious country to adopt this policy would be the UK as it is a treaty with them (the Joint Declaration) which the PRC is flouting in Hong Kong.  But it would be beneficial to virtually any free country.",2020-05-26 17:02:05,changemyview

CMV: Anyone whose reaction to the video of Amy Cooper threatening a black man was to worry about the dog is a racist.,"One of the things that really annoyed me about today’s social media response to Amy Coopers vile actions is that they were putting her actions against the dog above or equal to her racist, deliberate actions against the bird watcher. 

What she did do that poor dog was bad BUT what she tried to do to Christian Cooper was despicable. It was calculated, racist and unforgivable. She knew what she was doing when calling 911 and when she lied about the danger she was in. She wanted him hurt or maybe even worse. 

People whose first (or alarmingly - **only**) reactions are ""Oh poor doggy"" are as bad as she is. No matter how you spin it, ultimately they have decided that black lives are worse less than that of a pet. Succinctly speaking, those lives don't matter. 

It's exactly this mentality that ensures that these people refuse to believe black men when they come forward with complaints about police (sometimes even with video proof!). It's this mentality that causes them to call the police at the slightest annoyance at a black man. 

In my opinion, they are the middle ground racists that MLK said are more dangerous than the extremists.",2020-05-26 15:34:31,changemyview

CMV: The electoral college is outdated and the US should move towards a direct election for President,"Basically the title. Here are my main reasons why:

1. Small states' votes weight heavier than populous states (votes from Wyoming carry 4x as much weight as a vote from California)
2. The electoral college system gives an incentive to campaigns to only focus on states that are considered ""swing states"", which marginalizes the vast majority of voters. 
3. It discourages voter turnout. Democrats in red states and Republicans in blue states often feel like their votes is useless because of the dominance of the other party in the state, combined with the fact that 48 states mandate a ""winner take all"" approach to electoral votes in their state.
4. Proponents of the electoral college say the current system forces candidates to focus on lightly populated states. In addition to point 2 above as a refutation of that, a look at state election for governors/senators, etc. where direct elections take place show us that candidates still focus on the lightly populated areas of the state where the election is occurring. Why? Because in a direct election, every vote matter.

CMV: I don't understand how pro-gun is a defensible position.,"I'm not American, but as a kid, when I realized guns, the shooty-shooty death machines we see on tv, are actual things you can privately own in America, it seemed ridiculous. To this day, it is absolutely hilarious that it's like this (except for when a shooting happens once a month and then its a bit less funny). How can you even claim that you need them when there are no gun shops in Europe, and they get along just as good as you (depending on who you ask, maybe even better). Even though to me, it's pretty clear that America's insanely high (for a first world country) homicide and suicide rates are due to the high availability of firearms, some can argue about that forever. So I'm not going to question that, but what I think I can say is that even if you think guns are harmless to society (which they are very clearly not), why does the average Joe need one? 

To me, having guns be available to a massive range of people where it isn't relevant to their professions is just endangering people for no reason. If I moved to the US for the rest of my life, I might buy a gun, just because so many others have one. I think that the availability of firearms creates the threat that causes people to buy firearms, and it's a problem. I can't even think of how America is going to get out of this problem, just because there are so many guns out there, and they would just create a massive black market for weapons. 

To me, the concept of privately owned killing machines is absurd, but I understand that there are many that want guns to stay, so change my view.",2020-05-26 15:01:03,changemyview
CMV: There are appropriate places in government for both conservatives and progressives.,"*Disclaimer: The terminology and governmental structure I'm referring to are those in the US, as that's the only place I've lived and am confident enough to talk about. I'm sure some of the principles (hopefully most/all) apply to other parts of the world as well.*

It's hard to see in the polarized political climate we're facing today, but there are positives and negatives to both sides of the ideological spectrum.

I will now go on to make some very broad characterizations of ideological frameworks; I know that not all people who are 'progressive' or 'conservative' will share all of these characteristics and/or views.

Conservative ideas tend to be more cautious and anxious, generally approaching the world (or parts of it) as a dangerous place that people need to be protected from. They tend to be pragmatic, willing and able to make difficult decisions, even when those decisions will undoubtedly harm some people. (Sadly, these decisions are sometimes necessary.} Conservative ideas also tend to be deliberate, necessarily considering every possible pitfall of a new plan before that plan can be implemented. They are able to consider tangential consequences on things like the economy, military standing, and international power dynamics. They value adherence to norms and laws.

To me, these characteristics serve certain leadership roles very well: budget balance, national security/military, oversight (or other deliberation-oriented) committees, etc.

Progressive ideas tend to be idealistic, empathetic, and future-oriented, assuming everyone is fundamentally good and deserves a base level of humane treatment. They tend to put ideals above other concerns, starting from a place of what we *should* do, rather than what we *can* do. They emphasize legislative and practical impacts on people first, rather than any other interest. They value fairness and equal opportunity and are willing to give help to everyone, even if it helps some baddies, rather than help fewer to avoid aiding the undeserving. They value making change to try and improve things and not sticking with a status quo, even if that status quo works for most, but not all, people.

These characteristics would do well in charge of: budget allocation, domestic issues (e.g. housing, jobs, and education), technology/science, etc.

Obviously, many issues need a wide variety of perspectives, and this goes to further my point. Each ideological framework has strengths and weaknesses, and we need to harness those strengths in the correct places to have a highly functioning government that works best for all people. A functional system of healthy debate would also help minimize the weaknesses of either group.

If any one religion was correct, it should have sprung up in multiple different places (with slight variations) independently of one another. But that hasn't happened.

Religions only exist as a way a community develops understanding of the world and a moral/legal system. They are human made to suit human needs. That's fine, but the second people start trying to impose things on others or harm others because their particular religion says so and their particular religion is definitely right, we're crossing into ridiculousness.

Many of these differences can have a positive impact on various groups of people, especially women, minorities, LGBTQ, and others, if Biden is in office.

For example, Biden did co-sponsor the violence against women act and he did declare that he supports gay marriage.

While there might not be much, if any difference between Biden and trump to, say, an average white male, there can be significant differences for those less privileged.

CMV: Netherlands - Mosques should not play the call to prayer,"A few years ago there was some discussion in the Netherlands about mosques that where being build and if they would be allowed to play the call to prayer out loud from the minarets. At the time most of the public supported the issue because of religious freedom. The call to prayer has been compared to the church bells that typically ring on a Sunday. 

I do think there is a big difference between the call to prayer from a mosque and church bells. For one; a lot of church clock towers ring every half and full hour to indicate the current time. Two; church bells are instrumental only, there is no verbal message being broadcasted. 

Besides the Netherlands is as a country not connected to a particular religion. If an individual wants to believe something that's fine, but don't bother others with your decision. I don't want to hear your call to prayer played while I'm in my back yard. Religion is something you may practice in your home or religious house but don't broadcast your message publicly by speakers. 

And maybe it's because im used to church bells in a way that I find them less offensive as a way to call for a religious service. To be clear: if the choice is forbid all public calling for prayer or service however that may be I'm all for that. So no call for prayer from mosques, no church bells before the start of a service and other callings I'm forgetting to mention. 

(Excluding church bells to indicate the current time, that has no religious connotation. So that's fine.)

It just surprises me that a lot of secular people in the Netherlands seem fine with the invasion of religious callings/tradition in everyones life. Why? I don't think it's intolerant to don't want to be bothered by someones religion. You may pray to whomever you want, but **don't** confront me with it.

CMV: A 4-day work week is a bad idea,"Everywhere I look, I see people advocating for a 4-day work week, and I really don't think it's a good idea.

I have two main issues. The first is that I don't think most people can work 10 hour days productively. Perhaps one can work 10 hrs in a bluecollar job, but I don't think that's the case for an office job. I read somewhere (I can't remember where) that most people only actually work 4 hours a day and productive people work 6. If that's the case, going from 8 hours a day to 10 seems like you'll lose hours of productive work each week. 

My second reason, and more important, is that I don't think 4-day work weeks are conducive to a balanced lifestyle. A healthy, well adjusted person, has good daily habits. Things they consistently do each day - Cook, clean, hobbies, exercise, spend time with family, etc. Adding two hours of work to four days a week really limits the time one has to balance their lives with non-work activities. It limits the ability to form good habits in multiple areas of your life. Yes, you'll get a 3 day weekend, but three days out of 7 isn't enough to form healthy habits. 

Personally, I'd rather see an increase in hourly wages, and a decrease in daily work hours. I'd much rather work 6 or 7 hours five days a week than work 10 hours four days a week.",2020-05-26 11:28:33,changemyview

CMV: The Democrats have lost my vote for life as long as they stick to the path they're on/been on for decades.,"I'm 27 and have always voted Democrat since I could vote, and supported Democrats before that.

I supported Obama in 2008, voted for him in 2012 and vote for Clinton in 2016.

I, however, do not plan to do the same for Biden this year, or indeed, any Democratic candidate going forward. 

In retrospect, I now regret that past support, those past votes and wish I had done so for 3rd parties instead, which I will likely do from now on.

That's because over the last 4 years, my overall opinion on them has only worsened, from seeing them as ""the good guys"" to ""only slightly better than the Republicans"".

After actually looking into them and their record for the past several decades, I've come to the conclusion that they're a bunch of spineless, cowardly, corrupt wimps who barely if ever actually get anything significantly positive done for this country.

After 8 years of Obama, the ""hope and change"" candidate, the average American was still overall worse off than they were in 2008. The only thing I could really think of that he actually got done was the Affordable Care Act, which isn't *nothing*, but is still embarrassingly worse than the healthcare systems of many other 1st world countries.

And they don't appear to be changing any time soon since they're basically just running Male Hillary, who will likely lose like she did 4 years ago.

CMV: Foreigners should assimilate themselves into a culture,"I'm a first generation Slovak immigrant living in Austria. I moved here as an 8 years old boy and spend most of my life here. Although the cultures are quite similar, I'm glad that I now mostly fully assimilated the Austrian one. That simply makes life easier at all levels, whether on official visits, at work, or in private life. From my Slovakian origin I only kept regional knowledge, language and some recipies, thats about it. I leave it up to my children whether they want to learn something about it or not. But instead of wasting their time on a language that is not very common, like Slovak, I would find it a lot better if they learned English, Russian, Chinese or Arabic instead. But I will surely teach them that if they want to live in another country, for example China or Qatar, they have to adapt culturally if they want to be successful.

In Austria we have a large ex-Yugoslavian and Turkish community. Many of those people have even in third generation as Austrian citizenes problems finding their way in society. I have the feeling many have a ""us against them"" mentallity, simillar to the extreme minority group thinking you can observe in the states today. Where does this group thinking lead to? Well, on the whole, it means that guys who don't identify as Austrian have on average, depending on the culture of their origins, less respect toward Austrian authorities which leads to less education and thus a lower income, are likely to think that the Austrian man is weak, have no respect towards female police officers and teachers, are likely to take advantage of unemployment benefits and are generally more willing to use violence. I think it's obvious that this creates tension between real locals (= for me, that are people who actually identify as Austrian) and these groups.

Many of these minorities are convinced that the system is racist and deliberately disadvantaging them. I can say from my own experience that this is not true. Your ancestors moved to this country and messed up to adapt, just like you. It's not the system that has to change, it's you. Do you live in Austria and have Austrian citizenship? Then behave accordingly and do not try to build a cheap copy of the country of your ancestors in this country. Firstly, you have absolutely no right to do so, and secondly, none of the real locals want that. There is probably a reason why you are here now and not there anymore and if you don't like it here, go back or somewhere else that suits you better.

As a note, I'm not talking about small unimportant things like dishes or cultural dancing. An exchange of these things can be very rewarding. What i mean is the cultural interaction with people in everyday life. Also, I'm not sure about America because of their unique and diverse cultural history, so I can well imagine that you see it a little differently there.",2020-05-26 05:24:42,changemyview
"CMV: Homeschooling is a completely valid form of schooling that holds no less merit than public schooling, and in fact can be more beneficial for the student","I am 18 and have been homeschooled all of my life. People always hate on homeschooling and many don’t consider it a valid form of schooling. I guess I’m not looking to have my mind changed, but rather wanting to have a conversation to see why people might think those things. 

People say that homeschoolers are super anti social and have no friends. There definitely are plenty like that, as I grew up around them. But, being homeschooled actually allowed me to have plenty of time to do activities outside of the house where I’ve met plenty of people and made friends. I’m definitely not the stereotypical homeschooler. In fact, many aren’t. The only reason people think of homeschoolers as anti social is because those are the only ones people notice. 

Homeschooling also allows you to go at your own pace and tailor your education to what’s best for you. I never took physics or calculus. Why would I waste time taking subjects that aren’t relevant to the field I want to go in to? In public school, they make everyone more or less learn the same stuff at the same speed. Why should I have to go at a set speed if I am perfectly capable of going faster/can’t go fast enough? 

Homeschooling has allowed me to do something I never thought was possible. I am currently two college classes away from graduating with a bachelors degree in Organizational Leadership.... at only 18 years old. Yes, it’s with an actual college. Yes, it’s all legitimate work. No, I’m not some Will Hunting level secret genius. But, the ability to go at my own pace and tailor the education to my needs has allowed me to accomplish this. 

With this being considered, do you consider homeschooling to be an illegitimate or less legitimate form of education when compared to public education or not?

"CMV: Life Is Meaningless And Sucks, And Any Philosophy That Says Otherwise Is Just Lying To Oneself.","I’ve come to the conclusion that humanity doesn’t have a happy ending.

The more people there are, the more problems we face.

I used to believe, and still believe to an extent, that logic is really the only way to fix society’s problems. And of course, I’m sure that *I* am right, because I arrived to that conclusion logically.

But everyone thinks that *they* are right, don’t they? 

Thank god for democracy, everyone gets a say. They can make decisions that will directly affect their lives, except really only a minor part of them actually understands the full extent of this. The normal person doesn’t understand what the fuck is going on behind the scenes. And you can’t really expect them to either, it’s such a complex thing, so much bureocracy. It takes a career to truly make an informed decision on who to vote or what system of government is truly the best, and a *great* deal of thinking.

So logic is the answer to all of our problems, but logic doesn’t get you anywhere unless you are properly informed. If you don’t have all the points of view and information, your opinions are ultimately worthless. In order to achieve true philosophical truth, you need to have more information than is possible for a human to possess. So then, we’re fucked.

Capitalism clearly has a bunch of fucking issues, I bet a bunch of people will just jump to that statement and begin listing them off in their heads, based on their experience with it. However, as flawed as it is, it works, and that *also* fucking sucks, because if it didn’t work at all, we would get rid of it. But because it works *a little bit*, the people who aren’t completely informed, so most of us, will accept it as their ideology. Capitalism was just an example, because communism isn’t the answer either, or socialism, or populism, or any political ideology you want to throw at me. Again, because we don’t have all the information to truly make a system that works for everyone.

So again, we are FUCKED. We will only get a system that partially works. We will probably never arrive at a true utopic dream of a system, and that is depressing. 

Say you did want to get as much information in your head. Where are you going to get it? All of our data comes from other humans who have already thought about it. All future knowledge is based on the stuff that has been passed down. And that stuff that has been passed down is mostly incorrect, because again they didn’t have all the information. So we get their ideas and take the bad stuff out and keep the good stuff, but of course, we, the imperfect machines that we are, are making the decision of what’s bad and what’s good. So the problem persists! Because if you give the same info to a million people, they will all sort it out differently. Sure some will align, but that is because they are comparing the stuff they see to their own current worldview or framework or whatever.

We don’t win. We can’t win. 

All political discussion is utter bullshit. It means jack shit in the grand scheme of things. No one is right. Everyone *thinks* that they have the answers, but they don't. People still take sides because we are animals. You *have to* choose a side, because not choosing is worse for the system. 

The punchline is that I don’t have any of the answers either, and if any of you agree with me, then you are wrong too.

Change my view. Because deep down, I know that it is easier thinking there is an escape. But if you think about something really hard, you always arrive at the conclusion that everything you just thought about is wrong and meaningless. If someone delivers a really good argument and convinces me that being a nihilist is actually wrong, and I buy it, then gee thank them. I will be so thankful, I might even forget that I was the one who typed this up.

Sorry this got political, but that is mostly because I'm not feeling particulary existential right now. But basically life sucks, and all philosophies are designed to combat that fact and make you feel safe. And we don't have the information to get a true, correct answer, so therefore they are all wrong.",2020-05-26 01:50:35,changemyview
CMV: Abstention and/or a vote for anyone besides Joe Biden in the 2020 Presidential Election is a vote for Donald Trump,"PREMISE:

Barring total economic collapse and the loss of his incredibly loyal base of about 35% (which is possible but very unlikely), the only significant obstacle to Donald Trump's reelection is voter turnout. Trump's base will always turn out to vote for him. The more people that vote, the more liberal the voting base is in the ways that matter for presidential elections ([source](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-would-it-look-like-if-everyone-voted-in-the-us-2016-11)). 

This can explain, at least in part, the very significant and continuous Republican efforts to suppress voting rights and disenfranchise voters ([source](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/23/659784277/republican-voter-suppression-efforts-are-targeting-minorities-journalist-says), [source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/us/Voting-republicans-trump.html), [source](https://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-audio-trump-adviser-republicans-rely-voter-suppression-justin-clark-2019-12)). It also helps explain Trump's vehement resistance to and hatred of mail-in voting.

The individuals voting for Donald Trump will vote for him no matter what. Individuals who do not wish for Donald Trump to remain in office may either abstain from voting, vote for the Democratic candidate, or vote third party. 

Historically, 3rd party candidates have no chance of winning a Presidential Election. Thus, a vote for a third party candidate for president is essentially akin to a non-vote. 

This is the most significant presidential election of our time. If Donald Trump remains in office for 4 more years he will do more damage than can be repaired, take rights away from various identity groups as he has done and attempted to do over the last 4 years, and continue to pack courts. 

MY VIEW:

Given the veracity of the foregoing premise (which you're free to challenge as well), IF one is opposed to Donald Trump being reelected, then they must vote for the Democratic Party candidate, i.e. Joe Biden. Not because they like him or would choose him as their ideal candidate, but because any other vote is a vote for Donald Trump. 

By not voting, or voting for a third party candidate, one is essentially casting a vote for Donald Trump to remain in office. Either one of these options is essentially throwing away a vote to make a personal, selfish, privileged moral stand. If one believes in third parties, they should be helping local officials running on third party platforms win elections instead of throwing their vote away once every 4 years to prove a point to no one, while enabling Donald Trump to remain in office.",2020-05-26 01:26:57,changemyview

CMV: Captain America Is Gay. Marvel.,"I had to write a paper about pretending a fictional character is gay for an elective class of mine, and I chose Captain America.  Honestly, it works and I have convinced myself.  I can't lay out everything in this post because there is a lot, but I'll set out a few points.  Most of these points are not proof in themself, although some are pretty dang convincing, and all together provide a compelling argument.  

1. Steve was growing up in a time that was not accepting of gays.
2. First Avenger:  Steve had zero interest in women when prompted by Bucky.  (not saying that all straight guys have to be obsessed with the prospect of picking up women, but it just adds up with the other points)
3. Steve had three kisses, the random chick in the army, Peggy, and Peggy's Niece(weird).  I gotta say, Steve did not seem to enjoy any of them.  The random army girl I understand, but he did not seem to enjoy Peggy's kiss, despite pretending to be hopelessly in love with her for the rest of his time until endgame.  With Peggy's Niece, the attitude I saw was ""screw it, I'm gonna go for it"". and he didn't seem impressed, also it was in front of his buddies, also we never saw this girl again.  
4. Steve pretended to be hopelessly in love with Peggy for the entire marvel franchise, despite really not having much interaction with her.  Maybe he's a hopeless romantic, or maybe he's using the lamest cover of all time.  ""Yeah dude I have a girlfriend, you wouldn't know her though, she's from 1930"".  If you rewatch the first avenger, there really isn't much about Peggy, she's definitely in there, but not as much as you would expect for him to obsess over her for the rest of the movies he's in.  
5. Black widow came onto him and he didn't make a move:  I'm not saying that all straight guys have to be interested whenever a woman makes a move, but seriously, Scarlett Johansson? If you are single and straight and Scarlett Johansson makes a move, you go for that!

Anyway, here's my brief retelling.  Steve Rogers wants to join the army.  He is gay which is not acceptable in that time, and he really doesn't have a whole lot going for him.  He thinks the army will occupy him and he won't have to think about his true self that much.  Being rejected is really sad for him, he feels like he's not good enough for anything.  When offered the serum, it's a no brainer for him.  He buries himself being a soldier, he has no time to think about his sexuality, which bothers him.  He crashes into the ice and is frozen until 2011 I believe.  More accepting time for homosexuality, but he is still not at peace.  He again, buries himself in his work as an avenger, he is obsessed.  He definitely is the most hard at work of any avenger.  He wants to stay occupied so he doesn't have to deal with his sexuality.  At some point Tony stark tells him to get some life, and Steve refuses, because he doesn't want to face himself.  He tries to lift Thor's  hammer in Ultron.  He made it budge, but couldn't lift it all the way because he wasn't at peace with himself, that's what held him back.  In Endgame, it looks like everyone is gonna die, and at that moment, he realizes how silly and not a big deal being gay is in the grand scheme of things.  He is then able to wield the hammer.  Then, when he returns as an old man, supposedly after living his life with Peggy, he is asked by falcon to talk about her.  Steve, iconically, says ""No, I don't think I will"". He said he wanted to get some of that ""life"" Tony was talking about.  

I gotta say, there isn't proof, but watching the movies again with the narrative that he is gay, makes a lot of sense.  He's great, but kind of uptight and hesitant to get into details of his personal life or talking about himself, and uses the avengers as a distraction.  There's probably stuff I left out, but I will get into that in the comments if it comes up.  What are your guys thoughts?",2020-05-26 00:14:11,changemyview
CMV: Humans don’t have free will/free will is impossible,"a preface: there are a good number of unknowns here whether i point them out or not, so i admit my view is not resolute.


skip to my main point at the bottom if ur bored




to my limited understanding of philosophy, there are two main views: monism and dualism.



monism states that everything in the universe is made out of the same thing: matter. all that exists is matter (atoms, quarks, or otherwise) and void. this approach to philosophy is more consistent with science.




dualism differs by adding another type of “stuff” to the universe. this is often referred to as the soul or the mind. note here that the mind is not the same as the brain. it’s rather our thoughts (abstractly and also not referring to the electrical impulses).



now if dualism is correct, then mind and matter must interact (for the mind to control the brain to then move your body). this means matter is affected by something that is not matter (and no i don’t believe dualism says the mind is photons/light either). this violates our concept of matter as physical things can be influenced by non-physical things. this is where i eliminate the theory of dualism.





back to monism and free will (struggling to get on topic lol): let’s say souls don’t exist and humans are 100% organic chemical processes. this means that given the exact same situation multiple times (with the exact same mental state) our brains (and therefore bodies) will react the exact same way every time. this means we don’t have free will. if we could study our brain more, we might be able to prove this by predicting reactions in real humans.




okay but what about “soul atoms” as they’re called in philosophy and quantum biology must have some role too, right? you clicked on this post out of your own free will after all (supposedly).



the idea of the soul under monism is that soul atoms exist within our bodies concentrated around the heart and can choose differently in the same situation by “swerving.” sounds kind of wack but reminds me of quantum mechanics where a state is undetermined and true random number generators can be created (computer science).




the big question here is why does this count as free will? if these soul atoms or quantum particles in us swerve at random, then how can we call that free will?






MAIN POINT:



random, by nature, has no will. and as described earlier, deterministic systems aren’t free. these seem to be the only possibilities under monism, and dualism seems inconsistent with science.

CMV: Religion is Dangerous,"I personally am a non believer. I went to church with my family when I was younger and even at a young age I thought it was complete bullshit. If you believe that’s fine I’m not saying you don’t have a right and the following is just my opinion.

People believe so strongly in their religion that they will go to extreme lengths to serve their god or spread their beliefs on to others. 

Isis for example tried to take over the world and institute an Islamic state where all people would live under the law of Islam. They killed hundreds of thousands directly or indirectly during there escapades. They did all this is Allahs name. 

Jim Jones had such a large and strong following that he convinced people to drink poison laced koolaid leading to the deaths of over 900 people. Jones believed so strongly in his religion he destroyed his and 900 others lives. For what?

The Heavens Gate cult we’re convinced that killing them selves at just the right point in time would gain the access to heaven through some astroid or ufo passing by earth. (Don’t remember which one it was but it was something crazy like that). 39 people killed themselves in one day because of their strong beliefs. 

The isolated incidents like jones town and heavens gate are just a drop in the bucket but as history shows many large wars and conflicts were started over opposing beliefs in religion. Terrorist attacks continue to happen because of religious beliefs and I don’t see these things ending any time soon. 

Religion does have great morals to believe in and follow by I will give it that. I just think the bad out weighs the good.",2020-05-25 22:56:46,changemyview
"CMV: Having children is always selfish and wrong, no matter how well equipped you are to raise them.","Having children is not wrong *because* it is selfish, but I often hear that people who don’t have children are the selfish ones. This is wrong and here is why:

People who have children always do so for their own gain. This “gain” can be that they want someone to look after them when they grow older, to instill some sense of purpose or responsibility in their lives, to meet external expectations, or simply because they love the idea of raising a child. All of these things are selfish, but not necessarily wrong things to seek out. The issue is that people are creating a sentient being to meet these needs. 

Whenever any sentient being is brought into this world, you can be absolutely certain that they will suffer tremendously. Everyone will, at the very least, suffer the harm of death. Even parents with the best intentions (who have a lot of resources to be able to care for their child) cannot be sure that their child won’t develop a deadly health condition, suffer from horrible mental health issues, become suicidal, die in an accident, or so on. These are just examples of horrible things that can happen to someone, and most people brush them off by thinking “it’s unlikely to happen to my child.” But what about things that are more likely?   
 

Do parents even think about when their offspring will grow sick and old? Do parents ever think far ahead enough to think that their child is likely to die a horrible death from heart disease or some kind of cancer? Do parents consider the intense suffering that their child will experience when they have to deal with the loss of their parents or other loved ones? 

An unborn child cannot consent to the harms that they will inevitably face in life. Parents for some reason feel entitled to decide that all of the suffering bound to be experienced by the person they’re creating will someday be justified. It doesn’t really matter that most people will tell you that they are happy to be alive or happy to have gotten through some hardship. This suffering could’ve been avoided and that person is *already* here. Isn’t it wrong to subject beings to harm that they not only couldn’t consent to, but that were also completely avoidable? 

Often times, people will justify having children by claiming they want to bring someone in to experience all sorts of pleasures and joys. Before that child existed, however, it didn’t matter that there was nobody there missing out on all of life’s pleasures. You can’t deprive someone who doesn’t exist. But when you bring someone into the world, you’re guaranteeing that they will be harmed and that they will suffer tremendously like all living beings do. On top of all the basic universal suffering all beings experience, there is way too much uncertainty and risk of *especially* horrible things happening to that being. Sure, there is risk of harm in other things like driving a car, but drivers are knowingly and willingly taking those risks. An unborn child is not a willing participant. Anyone who has children is playing Russian roulette with someone else’s life and the gun is fully loaded. 

People could meet all their “altruistic” intentions to show love and care for a child, and to raise someone who will be kind and good to others by adopting a child who is already here or by rescuing another sentient animal in need. This would truly be selfless.  I am not against loving each other and showing compassion for others. This is precisely why I will not create a being who will definitely suffer and who will likely cause others to suffer just to meet my selfish desires. 

Change my view that having children is ALWAYS selfish and wrong.",2020-05-25 21:56:29,changemyview
CMV: I shouldn't have been born earlier. I believe I would've had a better life if I had been born in 2000.,"Would any Y2k kids / millennium babies like to chime in and tell me how they liked and disliked being born in the year 2000? (Or at least anytime in the 2000s?)

I LOVE technology; I just can't get enough of it. I'd be a cybernetic cyborg with robotic implants if I would be allowed to replace my natural limbs with anything superior to them, but of course, we're not advanced to that point yet.

I think access to learning websites on a ""children's internet"" from an early age would've benefitted me academically. I'd fall in love with educational games that would teach me stuff I'd need to succeed in school.

I also think the LeapPad and other forms of childhood technologies would've given me an advantage.

I think more advanced gaming consoles than what I had (Nintendo &amp; Super Nintendo) would've made for a fuller and more exciting gaming experience.

I would've loved to keep friends long after they moved away thanks to social media maintaining those connections.

Having access to PhotoMath, MathWay and other educational aid apps would've given me an advantage in academics had I accessed them as a teen in the 2010s.

I think kids and teens may have been more awesome to make friends and hang out with in the 2000s and 2010s than they were in earlier years.

CMV: Democracy is not the best form of Government.,"To start I’d like to say I have a major in Political Science, a minor in history and a minor in Cinematography(last one isn’t relevant) while working towards a masters in Political Science. Specifically in international diplomacy. I say this not to brag, but to show I have done extensive research on this topic and ensure that this is not a shit post.

Humanity learns to govern themselves better and better as we learn and evolve. The country with the “best” form of government usually becomes the strongest nation in the world and then that form of government trickles down to the less powerful nations. Great examples of this are the Roman Empire being an Imperial system ensuring that Europe and the surrounding regions for the most part would have a single ruler for centuries to come, the USA and the USSR coming out of World War 2 as the most powerful nations and splitting the world between “democracy “ and Communist regimes. During this time the USA set up dictators to directly benefit their own interests. I see this as the time where democracy started to fall. The officials in the United States did not have the confidence that democratic nations would support them(which they should not be forced to) or communist sympathizers were elected and then assassinated by “Pro-Democratic” forces. The USA wins the Cold War so according to my theory the entire world should become democracy at least for the most part, right? Then why hasn’t it happened. I think it is because when there is not a single clear voice leading the nation as there was during those times of war then democracy fails. Now a days we see democracy failing us everyday. We hear about red tape preventing great legislation being passed and people upset over minor issues preventing the major ones being solved. In addition the United States is not the most powerful nation given China’s current standing on the world stage. At best the United States is slowly being taken over by China and at worst the two nations are almost equal in strength. 

There has to be a better way for our world and our species to govern ourselves. Democratic nations should represent people equally. If that is in gender, sexuality, and race then our government is greatly unrepresentative of our people. If that is in ideas then even then we are still not being represented in the correct way.

CMV: People Who Own Property And Control Housing Are Mostly Skilless And Make Profits Exploitatively Off The Backs Of The Working Class,"People who own property and control housing are mostly skilless and make profits exploitatively off the backs of the working class, who as a side note, are mostly resigned to working for mega corporations who also sacrifice the well being of the working class and promote negative levels of class inequality, while the winners in this system pat themselves on the back and continue to snowball wealth off generations of investments, and the disillusioned poor toil away as replaceable cogs dreaming of better lives in a sham meritocracy. 

Capitalism, historically, has been successful in creating great amounts of prosperity for humanity, even with the presence of such inequalities, but just because it has the best proven track record doesn't make it infallible, and it is in need of major reformations and compromises.

CMV: Equal rights INCLUDES Men's rights,"TL;DR-Equal rights includes men's rights and should be viewed as bringing each gender up, not bringing women up and bringing men down. There are pro's and cons to each gender and I'm sick of hearing how men have zero issues just because they're men. I can be both a supporter of men's rights and advocate for equality at the same time, but society doesn't see it that way, they see it as a competition. 

I'm all for women's rights. I want women to have to have good access to education, employment, and healthcare just like anybody else does. I'm sick of, however, is saying that men basically have zero skin in the game.

Equal rights includes rights for men.

Equal rights in 2020 is not that. Equal rights is about control, it's about taking power, when it should be about lifting both genders equally rather than bringing women up by tearing men down. Fathers get virtually zero representation in today's divorce court. Fathers get zero representation in child custody, and they get zero representation even though they are half of the equation of having a child.

In a divorce case, most of the money flows from men to women. I know two divorced dads. Guess who doesn't get child support from the women and they had to fight just to get custody of their kids? That's right, they don't. Where's the equality there? Women are more represented in men in higher education, getting degrees at multiple times the rates that men's are, more scholarships and more inclusion opportunities available than men.

Violence against men is ridiculed and mocked at where as when violence happens to women it must immediately be stopped. But nobody cares if a guy is getting beaten or mugged on the streets.

Equal rights advocates should be fighting for equal rights for BOTH genders, not bringing one gender over the other by beating them down.

I can both be an advocate for men's rights and support women's rights at the same time. Stop making it a fucking competition.",2020-05-25 19:57:07,changemyview
CMV: God cannot reasonably expect humans He created as rational creatures to believe in faith-based salvation.,"I spent the first 20 or so years of my life as a devout Christian, and though I've read the Bible cover-to-cover and had multiple discussions with pastors and other well-read Biblical teachers, I've never heard a satisfactory answer to this particular issue, and it's a large part of why I no longer consider myself Christian today.


To clarify the position stated in the title, I believe that God acted very unfairly by creating humans to be rational creatures in a logical, causality-based world, but then expecting them to believe in--and in fact, structure their lives around--a supernatural, undetectable deity, the only evidence for which is first and second-hand testimony of men who lived over 2000 years ago. This deity claims to have created humans, the world, and all of time and space, and yet the skillset required to survive in the world He created is the *opposite* of what He expects from humans. To create a world that requires [A], and creatures that inhabit the world inclined to do [A], but then ask instead that those creatures deny their natural inclinations and do [B], is creatively irresponsible at best, and absolutely cruel at worst. 


Allow me to start from what I believe will be common ground: I think we can all agree that humans need resources to survive, and we live in a world where these resources are finite. Consequently, we must be judicious with these resources, otherwise they could be wasted or lost. One way to lose these resources is through theft or deception from other people, who want these resources as badly as we do. Since other people are a potential source of conflict and loss, we must protect ourselves by **being skeptical of information obtained from other parties**--in other words, we can't believe everything we hear, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. 


This brings us to the greatest source of evidence for Christianity: the Bible itself. As previously stated, from a purely descriptive perspective, the book is a collection of first and second-hand reports and parables from men who lived over 2000 years ago. In legal proceedings, eyewitness testimony is considered the weakest form of evidence there is, even when there are other living people around to corroborate and vouch for the witness's character. We have no such luxury with the Bible, so any portion of it could be full of half-truths, if not completely fabricated stories. As such, **we cannot consider the Bible a reliable form of evidence of the supernatural.**


That said, what we *can* glean from the Bible is the *expectation* of what God would want us to do... and frankly, it's a pretty big request. In short, He commands that we give selflessly, love openly, and devote our lives entirely to God. However, in a world as chaotic and unpredictable as ours, it's the prudent man who saves and prepares for unexpected hardship that survives and thrives. Those who get by on the bare minimum, who save nothing for the future, can find themselves facing potentially irrevocable harm should that hardship arrive. In summary, **living the type of life advocated by Jesus in the Bible is contrary to one's survival.**


This isn't much of a surprise to those who have read the Bible. It's full of seemingly paradoxical statements like ""those who seek to save their lives will lose it, and those who lose their life will save it."" One could argue that the Bible tells us all of this, but it simply leads me back to the original issue: **if God gave us this rational, logical mind, and placed us in a world where seeking truth and obtaining knowledge leads to success, why would He then ask us to abandon this and devote all our limited resources to something that is categorically unprovable, based on the flimsiest of evidence?** In most other circumstances in life, betting on something like this with such high stakes would lead to disaster. If He really wanted us to follow His teachings, He should have created the world differently, or humans differently.",2020-05-25 19:14:34,changemyview
CMV: Life is not priceless,"If asked how much a life is worth, many would answer that it's priceless (that is, it's value is infinite) and even be offended than anyone would seriously consider the question. However, I claim that we can (and should) put a price on life.

1. We don't live our lives as though they were priceless. If we really believed that life is priceless, we would expend all the other non-priceless resources we have access to on preserving life. We'd buy all the safety features for a new car before we even thought on spending a single cent on entertainment. We'd never agree to work a job that offers the least amount of danger more than absolutely necessary (except if we believed that the extra earnings would make us less likely to die in other ways). In reality, looking at how much risk people are willing to trade off seems to suggest the value of life somewhere between 1 and 10 million dollars (here are some estimates: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life)).
2. We don't organize our societies as if lives were priceless. This is the same argument as 1., but on a larger scale. If as a society we believed that lives are priceless, it would be irrational for national budgets to include any expenses that cannot be directly translated into saving lives if we can instead pump the additional money into healthcare, safety infrastructure, etc. At the very least, we would have completely de-funded sports, culture and much of science and education.
3. There are lives for sale, but noone is buying. That is, there are predictable ways in which we could be spending money on saving lives, but we're not. [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness#Thecosteffectivenessfiguresweuse) is consistently able to find charities that are able to save a life for costs that are measured in thousands of dollars. One would imagine that if lives were really priceless, someone - either individuals, groups or countries - would flood those charities with money.

As to why we *should* put a value on life, I think the main reason is that, as a matter of basic principle, it's a bad idea to pretend that things are different that they acutally are. If we're living in a world that behaves as if the value of a life is finite, we should not pretend it's infinite. As a supplementary reason, it seems to me that saying that something is priceless, paradoxically, makes it less valuable. If we say that life is priceless then any time we actually need to engage in a trade-off that is likely to include lives lost (e.g. going to war), we need to phrase the dillema in terms a conflict of some fundamental values (e.g. freedom, spread of democracy, etc.). This way, everyone can hold whatever position is more convenient for them, without having to explain themselves too much. If we say that lives have a specific value (say, 10 mln dollars each), we can start having more concrete arguments: Is the war that we're going to engage in, which will likely cost X$ in lives lost (plus Y$ in spending, where probably Y &lt; X) is really worth it? Could we have accomplished more good at the same cost?

CMV: Men and Women's brains are fundamentally wired differently. If we acknowledged those differences instead of pretending they think the same way life would be so much easier.,"CMV: Men and Women's brains are fundamentally wired differently. If we acknowledged those differences instead of pretending they think the same way life would be so much easier.

Obviously there are exceptions to this rule (due to generic differences, gene mutations etc.) , but for the most part means brains are more wired to be rational and logical and their ability to compartmentalize things is a result of evolution.

Vs women are wired to be more emotional and they compartmentalize less due to evolution.

The way I describe it is that men compartmentilize their thoughts into boxes are usually only open one box at a time. The evolution part of this goes back to the hunter gatherer days. If the hunters were always terrified of predators then they wouldn't be able to function and hunt without the fear overwhelming them.

Women on the other hand had to compartmentalize their thoughts but needed many boxes open at the same time. They had to look for many different plants and watch the children and be ready for the men to return.

When men and women get into an arguement men open one box and argue the contents of that box. Women open up several boxes as they see them as being like an interconnected web. When they start arguing something from a different box ot confuses men as they don't understand why you are discussing boxes A, B, C, and D when the man is only talking about box A.

This causes arguments to escalate as your not arguing about the same thing.

CMV: Planet Fitness does not want you to get fit/healthy.,"A few years back I got divorced and had to stay with my brother for a while. I did they typical “delete Facebook and hit the gym” thing everyone talks about. I really did need it. 

The only gym close was a Planet Fitness. They didn’t have free weights but I figured I could make due with the smith machines and their cardio equipment was really quite good. Best thing, they were never crowded. 

On the walls of Planet Fitness they freely advertise that they are against the “LUNK” that would make a normal person feel out of place at the gym. Basically to them, a Lunk is someone that can lift heavy weights, is fit, and takes fitness seriously. Essentially, Planet Fitness believes they are intimidating and keeps people out of the gym. 

Planet Fitness has a “LUNK Alarm” where if someone drops weights, grunts, are flexing their muscles in the mirror, etc, a loud siren wails and red lights around the gym begin flashing. At this point the gym managers make a show of asking the LUNK to leave. 

Additionally, Planet Fitness gives you a dominos pizza when you sign up. And every morning they have free bagels for members. 

So after almost three years I visited my brother for Memorial Weekend and went to go workout. In the three years I’ve gone from 225lbs and fat to 145lbs and skinny to 195lbs with abs. 

I’m apparently a LUNK. 

I began my workout doing bench press on their Smith Machines. I worked my way up to 315lbs and then asked someone to spot me, as I don’t like using the safety guides on Smith machines. The guy was friendly but didn’t really know what to do. I explained it and he seemed alright. 

Two reps in alarms blared. Scared the shit out of me and I almost dropped the bar on my chest. If it wasn’t for my spotter I’d probably be in the hospital right now. 

Anyway, a cadre or employees lead by the manage all parades over me, loudly declared me a LUNK, and informed me I was not welcome at their gym. The employees began clapping as I grabbed my stuff and walked out. 

In the time I’ve been to Planet Fitness I’ve never seen one fit person there. I believe the place is a scam to bilk people that want to be healthy out of money. They do nothing to promote actual health and lifestyle changes and want everyone to remain fat and unhealthy.

CMV: Lifting sanctions on North Korea would be the best way to democratise the country and help the suffering citizens.,"I think the world would be a better and safer place if North Korea deviated from it's current path of oppression, aggression and insanity. We would rid the world of a dangerous despot who keeps more than 25 million of his own citizens in perpetual fear and poverty, and those of us outside of the country wouldn't have to be constantly afraid of what he might do next.

The question then, is how to do it. When I was young I often wondered why the UN didn't just swoop into messed up countries with an army and drag the wrongdoers in front of the International Court of Justice. Now of course I know better, and understand that the ensuing armed conflict would be incredibly costly, that China, one of the most powerful countries in the world wouldn't allow it to happen and most countries have massive domestic problems to deal with.

Armed insurrection then, is off the table. What about sanctioning and shaming them into being decent? North Korea doesn't really give a damn about the bad press it receives abroad. It's not like there were a long line of foreign companies looking to invest but were suddenly scared off by the state of things. Over the years they have become quite adept at dodging sanctions, and China can keep them afloat indefinitely, so they don't care about that either.

Trump changing tack and extending the hand of friendship seemed to please the Great Leader, but as far as we can tell, little has changed. Of course without proper knowledge I can't really speculate as to how well this has worked, but on the surface it seems Kim is still as crazy as ever, wants nuclear weapons and continues on as he has before.

So we must accept him. No grand gestures, or threats. Those didn't work anyway. Instead international trade will be allowed to happen unbothered, giving North Korea a chance to join the global economy. They will be forced to become more open and the exposure to the rest of the world will slowly but surely elevate them to a place where they have everything to gain from opening up to us and everything to lose if they misbehave.

"CMV: If you believe a boyfriend/husband has no say in an abortion, than it is hypocritical to not support paper abortion.","I just want to preface this topic with a few points about my personal beliefs that are relevant. While I consider myself Pro-Life I do not think widespread illegal abortion is a practical solution, rather I think we should have more support to limit abortions (more care for single mothers, contraceptive access etc.). I also think that if (as a man) you get someone pregnant whether it is a hookup or a serious relationship, it is your responsibility to care for your child and their mother, and anything less is deplorable. 

That being said I don’t want this to be an abortion argument, I am simply talking about the idea that within a relationship, the man has no say if the women gets an abortion which seems to be a major talking point of pro-choice crowds.  I want to be clear, I’m not advocating that a woman should need her boyfriends permission to get an abortion, however I think in the scope of a healthy relationship the mans opinion does matter and holds equal weight to the woman’s. 

Of course this is a nuanced issue as a pregnancy and a child effect the woman more, however I believe in a mature relationship the man should be able to pick up the slack to support his girlfriend in the pregnancy. 

This brings me to my main point which is that if you hold the opinion the man should have no say in the pregnancy of his S/O, than he should also have the right to a paper abortion otherwise the point is hypocritical. 

I would like to point out again, I am not advocating for paper abortion as a policy, I find it abhorrent, but I believe if you think a man should have no say in his partner getting an abortion than he should not be forced to give financial support for a child he did not want.",2020-05-25 17:22:29,changemyview
CMV: Today's hookup/ghosting culture is due to injustice we have all seen as children.,"Growing up, we have seen, at least on one occasion, our parents, teachers, coworkers, role models, class mates, etc., be taken advantage of/taken for granted. We have all seen or heard about someone close to us be treated unfairly who didn't confront it or not have been able to. 

I believe that this is why gen z'ers(and maybe millenials?) have the common reaction of saying ""men/women ain't shit"" and ghosting, when there are issues in a relationship.

Personally, I have seen my mother in a domestic abuse situation since she got married! However, she has developed a Stockholm Syndrome type thing where even if she could escape the relationship, she wouldn't. 

Situations like this, where the victim does not do what is best for them, because of power struggles in a relationship or whatever it may be, are us gen zer's worst nightmare and that has created today's hookup/settle-for-no-one culture, because we are scared of dependency and becoming our ""parents/person who was treated unjustly.""

CMV: Conventional Schooling/Education Track Might be the Wrong Move for this Generation's Kids,"Couple of addendum.  

\- My point of view comes from being in upper/middle class in a developed country and perhaps the scope of my claim might not extend beyond this. 

\- By this generation's kids, I am referring to kids who are under 10 years old.  

\- By conventional schooling/education track, I am referring to raising my kid to be studious in K-12 setting and devoting both financial and emotional support for them to get ahead in life (e.g. extracurricular activities, private tutoring if necessary, SAT prep courses).  In terms of finances, the last estimate that I've read for my country was around spending $200,000 USD from birth to high school for one kid from middle class (I suspect that variance might be large here so this isn't really a sticking point for my stance).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So now to my main thesis.  Most people work for roughly 40-50 years in their lives from age 25 to around 65-75.  So for a child who is 5 years old, this would entail that his/her working career would span from year 2040 to 2080/2090.   So as a parent, with everything else being equal, you would want your kids to find a profession where they can stay in that field up to year 2080/2090.  

It is my opinion that with advent of AI/automation, a lot of the jobs will disappear and not come back.  I am quite familiar with the field of AI/machine learning and recognize that many of the human skill sets (e.g. writing papers, composing music, creating artwork, playing games) are being surpassed by AI.  If not now, it will in the next 20-30 years.  Now, I recognize that this will also create new jobs, but it is my opinion that the number of new jobs being created will be less than the number of jobs that would be destroyed in the next 10-20 years (I think most of the predictions made by experts support my claim, but this can be a debatable point in countering my argument).  

So then, the question is this.  The path of least resistance is to just imagine that status quo will prevail and raise my kid (I have a 6 year old) in the conventional route that most of my family members have gone with (I am an academic with a PhD in engineering) in the past.  However, it strikes me that this might be a sub-optimal and a poor way of raising my kid given that many of the professions (e.g. law, medicine, engineering) might be different and essentially wiped out from job opportunity when he turns 18-20 years old (to say the last about what would happen 30-40 years from now).  

One alternative solution is for me to just save/invest the money that would have gone to his extracurricular K-12 education (noted as $200,000 USD above) and just give it to him as a starting seed money later on.  In other words, the strategy would be to de-emphasize the need to go to an elite school and completely get out of that rat race altogether from the beginning.   The path of least resistance is to do what everyone else is doing and spend money on education.  But it seems like that might be burning money as in year 2040-2050, there is minimal need for a lawyer, a doctor, an engineer, etc.  

But that is just the financial aspect of it.  It is conceivable that we are living in an age where what you learn through K-12 education becomes completely irrelevant and not really build up to any useful knowledge that can be used for your future profession.  Moreover, there might be a healthy alternative where we just homeschool the kids and let them enjoy life and just dabble into random activities here and there without being limited and stressed by the current educational track that might be a road to nowhere in 20-30 years.  

By my nature, I am not a person to take a bold stance on something like this, so most likely, I will just go with the general tide for my child, but I am skeptical on whether society will be so different in 20-30 years that the current K-12 education and financial burden prompted to put my kid into an elite university would be a big waste of time.

"CMV: Jo Jorgensen, the Libertarian Party nominee, is our best option for the future of the US in the upcoming election","Let me start this off by saying this: I know that nobody is going to vote for her, or at least not enough people to make a difference. People have been scared of third parties for far too long. Jo Jorgensen is a 63 year old grandmother and a psychologist with a PhD, as well as an MBA. She is an inspiration to women, whereas Trump is an insult and Biden is inappropriate. She wants to end the failed drug war and release all people incarcerated for victimless crimes. She wants to downsize the federal government and eliminate spending from needless agencies (ATF, NSA, stuff like that). She’ll block any new borrowing and give all cabinet secretaries strict budgets to slowly downsize the national debt, which is now $23 trillion. She will pull the US out of all foreign wars, making the US neutral and preventing the loss of life of thousands of good soldiers for the purpose of oil. Speaking of oil, she wants to gradually downsize big oil and coal in favor of nuclear energy and other alternative sources. 

I believe that most republicans and democrats are, by nature, at least somewhat libertarian. Now is the time for a woman president, especially one who is truly qualified. 

Jo provides the perfect rose between two thorns, we defeat Trump and we keep a (likely) dementia patient out of office (who also says racist things and likes little kids to play on his body hair.)

The people need to rise up against the tyrannical two party big government system we have been raised on. One of Washington’s greatest fears was a two party system. This needs media. It needs support.

"CMV: Uncle Iroh from ATLA is the strongest firebender in the series, not Ozai.","It is stated on the show that Ozai is the most powerful firebender in the world. I've always thought this was total bullshit given the evidence we see in the show. 

- Iroh invented the lightning redirection technique which is a HUGE GAME CHANGER against other firebenders. It's not just the invention of this technique that made him stronger. He then teaches it to Zuko who manages to one-up his much more powerful father in a 1v1 fight and escape. While Zuko doesn't outright win the fight, he clearly had the advantage when he redirected the lightning and made his escape. It's even possible Zuko could have killed Ozai then and there using ONLY IROH'S TECHNIQUE. So obviously, Iroh could kill Ozai in a 1v1 if his much weaker and less experienced student could have done it.

- A similar argument can be me made with Aang. But we can even take it a step further because of Combustion Man. Team Avatar is constantly on the run from CM in season 3. He quickly and easily pins down the world's strongest Airbender, one of the 2 strongest earthbenders in the world, and the granddaughter of the most powerful non-bloodbending water bender in the world. He does this regardless of whether it's day (when he's stronger) or night (when he's weaker). Let's compare that to Aang's fight with Ozai. During Sozin's Comet, which gives Ozai 10X HIS NATURAL POWER, Aang is able to quickly and fairly easily defeat Ozai using little more than dodging and Iroh's redirection technique but refuses to win by killing him. LITERALLY 10 OZAIS IS LESS OF A CHALLENGE FOR AANG TO HANDLE ALONE THAN 1 COMBUSTION MAN IS FOR HIM TO HANDLE WITH TEAM AVATAR TO HELP. This alone proves that CM was MORE THAN 10X more powerful than Ozai. As a side note, I'm aware Aang's firebending was also made 10X stronger, but Aang was still a novice firebender (intermediate at best) when this happened, so it's not like Aang became 10X stronger as a bender because of the comet.

As a secondary CMV, I'd say Combustion Man was the second strongest firebender in ATLA. Ozai can have third.",2020-05-25 16:02:06,changemyview
CMV: All non-vegans who condemn PETA are incredibly hypocritical as it does far more for animal rights,"Almost all of the major criticism that PETA faces stems from [this](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/03/petas-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-history-of-killing-animals/254130/) article. The article describes that PETA kills a very high percentage of the animals in its shelters. I do agree that this is obviously a failing on their part and that they definitely could have adopted more. Even though again this doesn't resolve the fact they are killing more animals than they have to be, they do accept all animals, even the ones that are totally unadoptable, meaning that they have no real future but death. In addition the stats from that article are over 9 years old, the ratio of animal deaths in 2019 dropped to only 60% killed. This is not good and an org with such a high budget should be able to do better, don't get me wrong.

However, the shelters are such a small portion of everything PETA does so i would point to [this](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/victories/) and [this](https://www.peta.org/category/miscellaneous-parent/rescued/) link where we see the various activities that PETA has done that are unquestionable beneficial to the cause of animal rights.  Another potential argument that you may bring up that condemns PETA is their radical tactics and donations to the ALP. Firstly, this is bringing up animal rights into the public discourse which gives it more time to be debated and hopefully provide an outcome beneficial  to animal rights. In addition I personally believe that logically, the exploitation of animals is the greatest wrongdoing on the earth right now, so radical tactics are completely justified ( IK almost all of you disagree on me here but i will be doing another CMV on that very soon so we can discuss this then). the last concern  I will address is the idea that PETA believes in total animal liberation (This means the complete abolition of meat, milk, cheese, eggs, honey, zoos, aquariums, circuses, wool, leather, fur, silk, hunting, fishing, and pet ownership). While i do not personally support something this extreme, the very fact that it is brought up shifts the overton window towards animal rights, allowing for more extreme solutions to be presented, even if they are not that extreme. 

Finally i have the crux of my argument. Almost all of the people that criticize peta for killing animals have payed people thousands of dollars to torture and murder animals.  If you don't believe industrial farming is torture, please read through [this](https://animalequality.org/news/why-factory-farming-is-the-largest-cause-of-animal-abuse-in-history/) entire page. According to [this](https://www.beefmagazine.com/beef/average-household-spent-961-meat-eaten-home-2018) the average household spends around $950 on meat products eaten at home, not including dairy or restaurants. I chose this source so you wouldn't think it is anti-meat as it literally comes from beef magazine.  PETA could literally donate money to factory farms and it still wouldn't have as negative of an impact on animals as all the non-vegans who criticize it, and as i have shown above, they do plenty of pro-animal rights activities.  I feel as if people only care about animal rights when it comes to people abusing their pets, but not the massive contribution they make towards prolonging the exploitation and abuse of animals they don't deem cute enough to live.",2020-05-25 15:51:55,changemyview
CMV: CCP should crush Hong Kong resistance and incorporate the city in into the mainland,"Let me preface this text that I consider myself a Communist, so please refrain from challenging my worldview since we wouldn't ever agree. I know that the CCP is not a perfect Communist party, but it is the only one with enough influence that can challenge the dominant, Western liberal-democratic management of the world. So I stand firmly behind its' actions and although I welcome intra-party debate and critique on the principles of democratic centralism, I think outside critique is illegitimate and even harmful in the long run.

With this said, what is these times happening with HK, I think is a good thing. HK should have been under CCP rule to begin with, the only reason they implemented One Country Two Systems principle was because it was British before it and they wanted to gradually incorporate it into the mainland. So it was never meant in the long run to be independent, different or whatever. What is happening was inevitable.

HK's special status is only harmful in the long run, it endangers the country's sovereignity, security and unity. Independence is out of the question, since it's economically too important and if I remember correctly there were polls in the last few decades and they always wanted to stay a part of China.

Having said that, resistance we can see now is only natural. They got used to the liberties they had and it is natural they fight for them. But if they can't be convinced peacefully to submit to CCP's will, they should be forced. I understand that a lot of people will suffer and even die, but these are casualties we have to accept. We won't build a better world without bloodshed, every major revolution in the history was violent, but ultimately it better the existential conditions of most people and made world a better place.

CCP, while not perfect, is the only party with enough geopolitical and economic power that can challenge the dominant Western worldview and decadent bourgeois mindset. Having said that, I believe they should go even further and finish the Great Cultural Revolution that Chairman Mao started, so they can eradicate lingering elements of bourgeois thought that pollutes their society.

If we accept that, we realize that HK is the biggest reactionary threat inside the mainland, so it should be eradicated by force, if it cannot be peacefully re-educated. The masses are clueless and don't know what is best for themselves, so they should not be allowed to make major political decisions and rather let the Party handle them. The Party itself follows principles of democratic centralism, where discussion, debate and critique are allowed and even welcome, but everyone must stand behind the decisions the majority makes. If the protesters want to influence the Party's decisions, let them join and convince them from inside. While I don't think nor want this to happen, let them try, so they cannot accuse how repressive and dictatorial the CCP is.",2020-05-25 15:28:46,changemyview
"CMV: For most people (you likely included), your IQ is a useless number.","**TL;DR - An IQ score does not measure intelligence, it was never meant to measure intelligence, and the term is thrown around so much that it's lost any worth it's had.** 

“IQ” is a term I hear used a lot. And every time I hear it, I die a little inside. To me, IQ is a largely useless metric for three major reasons.

**First, IQ was never meant to measure intelligence.** The original test battery that would become the IQ test was invented in France by [Alfred Binet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Binet) in 1904. Their original purpose wasn’t to measure intelligence; it was to screen young children for learning disabilities. Binet stressed three things about his test: 

1. The tests do not support or rebuff any theory of intelligence.
2. The tests are a diagnostic tool, and the scores are not useful for normal children. This test should not be used to rank average, everyday people in any way. 
3. These tests are for identifying children who need additional assistance. A low score does not mean a child is “beyond help” or should be isolated from the other children.

The tests then made their way to the United States, where the scoring metric was tweaked. (Dividing the final score by the person’s age instead of subtracting the age. Hence, “Intelligence Quotient” or IQ.) The tests then gained popularity in the US as a tool to rank normal, everyday people and to screen incoming immigrants to the country, in order to weed out all of the “morons.” (Scientific term at the time.) The man largely promoting this use of the tests, [Lewis Terman](https://www.verywellmind.com/lewis-terman-biography-2795523), was a huge proponent of Eugenics and believed that IQ was highly dependent on a person's genetics. He notably administered tests in English to Spanish speakers and to uneducated black students, and concluded that their low scores were due to their race. This a pretty questionable history for the IQ test, to say the least. They were never developed to measure intelligence, but they were used and popularized by Eugenicists to justify their views, which were common in scientists at the time.

**Second, IQ tests do not measure intelligence.** This is where I have to inject a my own belief: I believe that “intelligence” is one of those fuzzy, intangible qualities like “beauty” or “leadership.” It only exists in our minds. Sure, we could try to assign a test and a number to it, but it’s impossible to do so without some sort of bias. No ranking of “beauty” is perfect, so no ranking of “intelligence” can be perfect. The IQ test cannot measure “intelligence.” So what does it measure? Well, it’s just a measure of how well you do on the IQ test. **You want to increase your IQ? It’s simple: you study for the IQ test.** Same thing as the SAT or the ACT, they just measure how well you do on those tests. They don’t measure intelligence. And unlike the SAT/ACT, your IQ score has no practical use. No college is looking at your IQ score for admissions. So what's the point of even having an IQ score? You can't use it for anything!

**Third, the term “IQ” has been thrown around so much as to become meaningless**. The original IQ test has seen some resurgence in primary schools for diagnosing developmental disabilities early on. (Huh, using the tests for their intended purpose. Go figure.) But outside of scientific circles, the term is massively overused. People often use “IQ” to refer to general intelligence in a way that’s simplified, because the fuzzy and intangible idea of “intelligence” is too complicated to talk about easily. And then there’s the oh-so-many “IQ tests” you see on Facebook or other social media websites. Those tests are not the original IQ test, and they are not interested in measuring your IQ accurately. Those websites want your traffic. They want you to come to their website, see their ads, and recommend it to your friends. And nobody will recommend it if they got a low score; these “tests” give artificially inflated scores just to puff up their customers’ egos. Even if you believe that IQ tests measure intelligence, the massive number of fake tests that are prevalent on the internet and the fast-and-loose use of the word “IQ” has diluted the term to the point that it is meaningless. 

That is my view. I will never learn my own IQ, because I am a normal everyday person. As such, I believe that number is completely useless to me. **I will change my view if I can be convinced that there is some merit in the average person having an IQ score.**",2020-05-25 15:00:26,changemyview
CMV:human extinction is impossible,"barring some astronomical events like supernovas or gamma bursts, we''re basically ineradicable

nothing could kill 100% of the human population.

disasters can kill billion or millions of us, but total eradication? **impossible**

let's explore what made other species extinct:

* Most animals went extinct because of **competition** from other species which fortunately/sadly we don't face. The amount of animals that we're pushing to extinction is insane, but the reverse doesn't happen anywhere on earth
* Extremely few **pathogens** have 100% mortality, but those ones usually spread with difficulty, like HIV, rabies( by blood), the transmission rate is negatively correlated with mortality. also, the most developed countries would be successful at containing them, like South Korea, Germany showed us recently
* **global warming could kill billions, but wouldn't eradicate us**. We know from geological data that the Earth was much warmer at some point, and while it DID have a negative effect on mammals, most of them survived. Siberia and Greenland could sustain the remains of the human race. Billionaires could build the equivalent of space colonies
* **WW3? could kill billions, but can't seem to end us**. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were evilest regimes in human history, and yet they went away rather quickly. Nazi Germany lasted 12 years, while the Soviet Union lasted 69 years
* Other sources of extinction would be volcanic eruptions, asteroids, etc. but **natural mass extinctions** happen so rarely, once in 100 million years basically. We haven't detected yet an asteroid or supervolcano that is about to hit us this century, apart from Yellowstone, but last time Yellowstone erupted humans didn't go extinct

CMV: Medication to treat mental health should be a final option that's only utilized when all other sensible options are exhausted.,"In the US we have an issue improper treatment of mental illnesses. This is because doctors will throw medication to treat the problem a patient has but then the patient doesn't work towards fixing the problem and develops a dependance.

Now some doctors and patients do carry some of the blame for that the biggest problem is that it is often cheaper to just get a prescription than to treat a problem and insurance will take the cheapest option. But this is not a discussion about healthcare and insurance.

I have an education background in psychology and mental health, nothing major but enough to actually have a grasp on the subject better than the average person and couple that with my own mental health issues that I have found ways to handle has made me come to the conclusion that most cases of mental illness can be treated without medication. 

There are of course the extreme cases caused by serious chemical imbalances that are physiological and unaffected by outside sources that will need medication to be treated.

But a good number of mental illnesses are the product of society and life. People do have chemical imbalances that are significant enough to bring about depression anxiety and the like but not so bad that they need medication to be treated. Therapy and changes of one's life such as finding new hobbies and interests looking up good things that happened in the world rather than just focusing on the bad and cutting the toxic and dangerous people out of your life can get people to a point where they're no longer affected by their mental illnesses or at least give them to a level that they can dip down to a bad point and still be able to get back up on their own.

Some people can handle this on their own but a lot of them do need help a support group a therapist something to help them reach this point but I wholeheartedly believe it's completely doable without medication. The both doctor and patient need to be willing to put in the work.

I'll even concede that medicated therapy with the whole purpose of weaning someone off the medication the point where they won't need it anymore is a very viable option but trying to put somebody on antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication for life when they don't need that is terrible.

By no means do I think this is easy and in my own life I handled it alone and it took me significantly longer then it should have if I had a support group that I opened up to but it's still possible even alone. And I believe most people can do it.

And cuz I know people will wonder I don't consider marijuana to be medication because while it isn't it drug and I can treat these symptoms I don't classified as medication because of its lack of addictive properties and the danger that other medications cause. So marijuana is something that people who are dealing with a mental illness can consider because it is a viable option to help calm their mind and regain control of it.",2020-05-25 14:28:40,changemyview
"CMV: If I only have the choice between Biden and Trump, I should support Biden in the 2020 GE.","Reasons why in no particular order

1. SCJ pick.  A Biden admin will likely pick a SCJ closer to RBG than Kavanaugh, which would bring more balance to the court than if Trump gets to nominate a SCJ.  

2.  Biden is willing to increase taxes, which could be used in multiple ways, such as reducing the deficit and/or funding social programs.

3. Higher likelihood of healthcare reform under Biden than Trump.

4. Should the 25th amendment be invoked on either candidate, under Trump, we get uber religious and conservative Pence until 2024.  Biden's VP will likely be groomed to be running in 2024 anyways, and we will likely get somebody less left wing than Pence is right wing.

3-The unemployment benefits and added money (while probably more generous than I would have made them) is actually going to the furloughed, laid off and those most in need (and most likely to spend the money on our consumer economy).

Sex isn’t just about reproducing, and there isn’t anything inherently unnatural about two men being intimate with each other.

CMV: Hong Kong and Taiwan belong in to China,"Hong Kong and Taiwan do belong to China

There, I said it. Hong Kong and Taiwan should belong to China. 

Hong Kong was ceded to the British because China had lost the Opium Wars. The Opium Wars were fought because of the British smuggling massive amounts of opium into China in exchange for silver. This silver was then used to pay for tea for the British. China blocked off this smuggling of opium into China and the British were pissed, leading to the Opium Wars. After China had lost, Hong Kong was ceded as a British Colony for 99 years, and given back in 1997. Hong Kong was then to be governed under the one country, two systems until 2047. 

Hong Kong rightfully belongs to China. If it wasn’t for Britain and their colonial assholery, this wouldn’t be a problem today. There was an agreement made, and the agreement should be upheld.

As for Taiwan, well that is a total shitshow. The Chinese Civil War was a war fought between the  Republic of China (ROC) and the Communist Party of China (CPC). The CPC won and the ROC fled to Taiwan. An analogy would be during the American Civil War, the confederacy lost and fled to Alaska and set up a new government. They then claim that the they are the rightful government of the rest of the United States. The world wouldn’t recognise or support this party, yet western countries support Taiwan to push an anti-China agenda as they’re afraid that China will takeover as the world’s superpower.",2020-05-25 10:33:33,changemyview
"CMV: ""Breaking up"" Facebook as a way to combat ""fake news"" is unfeasible, or would at least be uneffective.","As a response to the fact that Facebook's algorithm governs how large, election-swaying numbers of people in many countries obtain their information, and the hazard to democracy this creates, it's been suggested that Facebook should be ""broken up"".

I don't believe that would be an effective - if even possible - solution to that problem.

First of all, I don't know what's meant by breaking it up.  Sure, you can spin off Whatsapp, etc, but that just means ""Facebook with a monopoly on information plus they own Whatsapp"" becomes ""Facebook with a monopoly on information"".

Surely you have to break up the social network part of Facebook.  Facebook.com.  That's where the eco system of memes and unverified snake oil exists.

How do you go about doing that?

This isn't like an electric company where I as a consumer don't care who the other consumers are.  The central value add of a social network is precisely who the other consumers are.  I'm on facebook because my family and friends are on Facebook.  If Facebook becomes two networks, I'm just going to create an account on both to get both halves of my social circle, as will everyone else, and then pretty soon we'll all start using the one more than the other, and within a few months, one of these new social networks will be crowned the new Facebook, fake news spewing filter bubbles and all.  Or worse, we all stop using both networks, they both go bust, and the government has essentially come in and destroyed an industry.

So if ""breaking up"" Facebook means spinning off some of it's properties, that doesn't address the problem, and if it means splitting up the network itself, that won't work.

CMV: Euthanasia should be legal because we deserve the dignity of a peaceful death &gt; long term suffering,"In my opinion, adults who are competent (e.g. conscious, doesnt have alzheimers, sober) should be allowed to elect euthanasia as a solution for intense and long lasting suffering. It's more inhumane to make people suffer for years, especially to illnesses like cancer, rather than have a peaceful death on their own terms. 

For non-competent adults (e.g. long term comas, severe alzheimers, otherwise compromised); their caregivers should be allowed to make that choice as well. If the prognosis is continued suffering and deterioration to an eventual death, they should be allowed to elect euthanasia in their care receiver's best interests. 

I think this could extend to children as well. If your child is born with severe disabilities or diseases (e.g. cancer, SMA, born very prematurely), in some cases it would be more moral to put the child to a peaceful death rather than raise them, watch them suffer, and eventually deal with their prolonged death. In some cases, a child might live in a hospital bed their whole life; this isnt a life but rather a parentally enforced existence. I understand this is probably my most contentious point, but I feel strongly about it. 

All aforementioned examples would obviously be counselled and performed by a medical professional.

"CMV: unless there’s a prior agreement, one should not tell their BF they’re pregnant if the BF gets no say.","Hi all!

So thank goodness this is a hypothetical debate. My GF isn’t pregnant nor did she need to have an abortion.

However, in reading the AITA forum, I came across someone’s post where they discuss aborting their baby and their BF getting upset. 

While I am Pro-choice, I sympathized with his situation as I can understand the feeling of helplessness and desperation when you want your baby and she isn’t willing to carry it. 

I’m perfectly open to being wrong about this, but I’d like more opinions, especially female or ftm men. I’ve always felt that if you’re going to make your BF aware that you’re pregnant, it should become the couple’s decision what to do with it. I understand not wanting to carry a baby, but in that case, why tell your boyfriend about it? That seems unfair and heartbreaking to me. My girlfriend would vehemently disagree.

Of course (smart) heterosexual couples prepare for accidental pregnancies and discuss their opinions ahead of time, so if one already knows that both parties are on board for an abortion, I think it’s fine to tell the BF and have him go to the clinic too. But if one knows their BF does not support abortion or isn’t sure, I think it’s wrong to inform him just to tear his hopes and dreams away.

"CMV: The vast majority of multiclassing in TTRPGs is done for power gaming reasons and starts Red Queens Races, which provide good incentive to stop players from being allowed to do it.","So we'll be talking *mostly* about our lovely D20 friends, D&amp;D 5e, but also D&amp;D 3.5, PF, and I'm sure people will chime in about other systems I know don't know.

But lets have a look at D&amp;D 5e. We have some level 8 characters. One character is a level 8 Paladin. Their main ability is Divine Smite, an ability that uses spell slots. A 8th level paladin has 4 1st level and 3 2nd level slots per day. Aside from this they also wear heavy armour and hit things with swords. (I know Dexadins exist). One character is a Level 8 Warlock. Their main ability is Eldritch Blast, which is a repeatable ranged attack that scales off charisma. They have 2 4th level spells per short rest. They wear light armour and avoid melee.

Our final character is a level 8 paladin 4, Warlock 4.

Why would someone play that? Because Warlock spell slots can be used to power divine smite, and recharge much faster and are more potent. Under a two short rest day, this character has effectively 3 1st level slots and 6 2nd level slots. They loose 4 hit points compared to a paladin, as well as an aura and a subclass feature. They loose 3rd / 4th level spells comapred to a warlock and a subclass feature.

In short, the multiclass can do most of what each class can do, and has significant gains over the single classed character in terms of utility, access to primary features and defensive capabilites (as applicable).

This becomes even *more* pronounced in games like Pathfinder where it's assumed a multiclassed power gamed build will be most peoples standard.

Can you have good roleplay with a multiclassed power gamer? Sure.

But for the DM it means making encounters that are able to handle the high power of that character. It means for the other players that their single classed character do less comparatively.

The DM has to increase difficulty to stop the multiclass from trivialising things, while other players have to optimise to even keep up in the face of this increased threat and difficulty. Possibly multiclassing and making the situation worse.

While there are pure RP multiclasses (I have a Wizard / Barb at my table atm), but they are a mere minority of multiclassed characters, and their roleplay almost never needs mechanical class backing.

The real source of the problem is that these roleplay games have front loaded classes, meaning most of the features are in the first few levels, and that games are exceptionally focused on the first half of character progression, meaning that the highest level content for the classes wasn't going to be reached anyway, so why not multiclass and lock yourself out?

Short of re-writing the classes, the solution to this red queens race of multiclassing should be to prevent multiclassing as a table level decision. When one player asks to make a power gamed multiclass, they should not be allowed to.

This keeps everyone on an even playing field, rather than having people who (lets be honest) looked up 'optimal' guides online creating difficulty for the DM and other players.",2020-05-25 03:31:50,changemyview
CMV: You can’t actually live for other people,"I have a lot of friends who tell me that they dedicate their lives to other people. This is not to say that a girlfriend says she lives for her boyfriend. Or a son lives for his mom, but these people say they LIVE for other people.

For clarification, I’m saying that these people, we’ll call them philanthropists cause that’s what they call themselves, do all in their power to help anybody.

My issue with this is that they clearly don’t. Most of them have people they hate. And when you hate someone you obviously wouldn’t help them if they needed it. Already, I have proven that there are people out there that they don’t live for.

These “philanthropists” are jokes! They only sit with their friends, never allowing new blood into their groups. They never give to charity or donate time for any organization. These people love possessions which, if you ask me, is kinda the opposite of philanthropy.

CMV: big data isn't that bad,"Nowadays it seems like nothing can be completely free from politics, not even occupations. Maybe it's a general attitude, though I have seen it a lot more amongst my left-leaning peers. I'm a lefty uni student who studies information systems. I am likely to work in big data, data warehousing, data mining etc.

- ARGUMENTS -

1) internet privacy isn't that simple

I understand people want a sense of privacy, but by using the internet you should accept nothing will ever be completely private. The same people that advocate against big data willingly sell their details to Facebook quizzes. I understand it lies in consent, but from how many people mess up with giving consent to truly malicious places, it shows the average internet user really doesn't know enough about data to think they have good judgement. 

2) big data isn't inherently evil

Big data is so useful for many things. Yes, like everything, data can become weaponised for selfish or malicious purposes, but it's unfair to paint it all in a broad stroke. Many things can benefit from having good access to data and being able to refine it. Public services, national security, predicting diseases, cloud based applications all require an ability to deal with data on a huge scale. You never know, some of these things might benefit you. If you've ever had to research trends for any reason, you'd know how frustrating it is when data is incomplete or full of impurities right?

And what is the real worst that can be done with data? If you're living in a country where mass surveillance extends to every corner of life and can lead to horrific abuses of human rights and censorship, then I'll get that. Chances are you're a regular person with a regular life, the worse you'll ever get are some creepily on-point ads on Google (which you wouldn't even see anyway with an ad blocker).

3) you're not in danger from it

Also, big data is called big data. It's not interested in who you are as a person. You're not as important as you think. Sometimes, depending on the collector, they purposely provide measures so individual tuples can't be isolated. It's not perfect of course but flow control is something that definitely matters for data collectors so the information can be kept safe and relatively anonymous. 

It's not even that hard to keep yourself private if you really care about it. You can read up on privacy policies, withdraw consent in most things and there are rules and regulations in place which holds data collectors accountable for their actions on a legal level. 

- SUMMARY -

Basically, what I'm seeing here is a knee-jerk reaction from individuals that value their identity and likes to bash any type of authority. I can understand that people want to feel in control and want privacy in their lives without interference. But we live in a state, and that means we are all alas interconnected. I'm not saying big data is fantastic, all I'm saying is people are overreacting about it and should do research before advocating against it, especially if they're going to be politically charged. 

I'm still quite early into this topic of study so I'm not someone with a hardened, defensive opinion on this. I really want to hear why people dislike big data and have such paranoia about it. Change my mind.",2020-05-25 02:56:49,changemyview
CMV: Anyone 14 and older should automatically be registered to vote on their 14th birthday and be allowed to vote.,"In my opinion, everyone over 14 (and possibly as low as 12) should be allowed to vote in all elections. It would introduce the idea of participating in the national community at an early age, help teach good habits, help them gain representation for their opinions, and help them transition into being a productive adult. 

My logic is that teenagers ages 14 to 17 are going to be dealing with any possible consequences of the government’s actions for the longest time, since we are also the youngest people. A 24 year old doesn’t necessarily represent the opinions of a 14 year old. Also, why should some 80 year old (who stands a much higher chance of not living through a presidential term) be allowed to vote but a 16 year old not be allowed to vote, even though they are the ones getting hit with the fallout of older voter’s decisions?

Another reason is that one of the founding ideas of America is representing all people, so minors should be as well.

Another reason is that many 16 year olds are already active participants in society; many have jobs, driver’s licenses and pay income taxes. This can be connected to my representation argument, since the thing that launched America as a nation was “no taxation without representation,” so either don’t take our money or let us vote. 

Now you might make the argument that “they haven’t even completed high school, so their opinions are less valid,” well I have two possible answers.

1) 34% of Trumps voter base were only high school educated or less people. A further 63% of his white base was not college educated. 28% of Clinton’s base had high school or less education and 26% of her white base was non college educated. So the argument that their opinions are less valid and thus they shouldn’t be able to vote is bull unless you are willing to prevent tens of millions of people from voting.

2) Education level is virtually no different from literacy tests which were used to suppress the voting rights of many Americans for centuries. They are both based on academic abilities. 

You could also say that we are simply not mature enough. But, thats not necessary true. In fact I believe that the ability to vote would increase teens attention to politics.",2020-05-25 02:16:42,changemyview

It is important to note that under this system the parties would have 100% control over everything internally, who they allow on their ballot, who they allow to join, if they allow primaries, whether to kick someone out of the party or not, all that stuff.

The parties would then have 1 week to form a majority coalition to choose the speaker or the leader of the largest party in the largest plurality coalition.


**For the senate** we abolish parties, each candidate is independant, Each state would get 2 senators as current, each official religion in the US would get 2 senators, and each racial/ethnic group counted on the census would get 2. In each group one would have to be female and one male.

Everyone then gets a ballot with their state, religious, and ethnic candidates and they rank each groups candidates. Each round the person ranked the lowest is out and their voters next choice gets added to the remaining candidates until one reaches majority.

Having more groups represented would really help the senate be a body representative of all types of people making sure laws don't hurt specific groups.

**Closing**

The house has no reason to be split up into districts since it is meant to represent the people. and the senate was made to give voices to the states and could be made better expaning that to other groups with their own unique needs

**Changes from previous answers**

No more religion or race based seats but 50% still women.

Half the house seats being districts with gerrymandering banned and the other half being proportional.",2020-05-25 01:53:07,changemyview
CMV: Having children is immoral,"You don't know how their lives will turn out, you are having a baby not realising that it will grow into an adult, and then an elderly person. Consider the state of the world, the possibility of diseases and war. Life contains so much suffering, and there is no guarantee that they will find happiness or even just contentment. The child could experience disabilities, birth defects, bullying and even racism for some. Every person has some degree of trauma from their childhood.

Their life will be largely dictated by their intelligence levels, social skills, attractiveness, race and social class. All these things are at least somewhat innate and intertwined i.e. social skills and attractiveness, I don't care how much character you have, you will never be able to change an ugly mug through will.

Is it fair to create a whole human life just based on selfish desires, a consciousness that never chose to spontaneously emerge? I don't think so. I believe life in general entails far more suffering than pleasure.

CMV: Homosexuality is deviance,"There is a base behavior which is heterosexuality. And anything that differs from that is a deviance. Any deviance from the norm is immoral.

Further down those spectrum are stuff like pedophilia, necrophilia and paraphilia.

I base the moral standard on the Bible since that is where most laws are based on in western context. Humans perform an array of immoral acts so that is not to say that they have to be judged on all of them.

Some claim it to be based on genetics but that is not my argument. I’m just saying that it is still immoral whether it is natural or not. Some people were born as sociopaths and that does not make it any better. Some claim they are born attracted to children. Once again, I’m not arguing this point, I’m just saying that being one way and acting on it is two separate things.

CMV Pro-life argument is illogical,"I’ve heard every pro-life argument there is and I feel like it’s impossible to logically implement legally. This does not address the moral issue.

**1. Life begins at conception**
Many pro lifer claims that life begins at conception but this is simply untrue. Life begins when you are living. To claim this, then every abortion is murder and women who do so have to face murder charges. Fetuses (or babies in this scenarios) should be able to buy insurance. Everyone’s birthday would also be based on when your mother finds out she is pregnant.

**2. What about people in vegetative state?**
What about them? They have started living and became the way they are. Fetuses haven’t started living at all, so they are not technically living beings at that stage.

**3. Which trimester should abortion be allowed then? Is the birth canal the only thing that separates a fetus from being human?**
Abortion should be allowed based on how likely of complications to arise by the mother and should be determined by medical professionals. The birth canal, or more technically, the removal of a surviving baby from the womb is what defines living. As in, you need to literally be able to start living.

**4. Upon conception, fetuses are already potential for a human life.**
Sure this is accurate but then every withdrawal or masturbation should be considered genocide. Potential human life have no rights, only human life (granted once you enter the world). 

To follow this line of thought, murdering a fertile couple would indite you for additional charges for their potential children. Women would have to give birth to kids of rapists or kids that will lead a horrible life with deformities, without a choice.

I would love to hear pro life views that can be realistically and consistently implemented.",2020-05-24 23:13:30,changemyview
CMV: I do not believe there is any significant (in terms of size or power) fascist/white nationalist movement in the United States.,"It seems to me there are a fair amount of liberals who essentially believe the GOP is the party of neofascism and we're hurtling towards a fascist (or white nationalist - gonna use those fairly interchangeably here) state at an alarming rate. There seem to be quite a few leftists who believe we are already there (e.g. slogans like ""scratch a liberal and a fascist bleeds""). Articles about the ""rise"" of fascism are a dime a dozen. 

I'm just not seeing it. I don't see any compelling evidence that there's a particularly large amount of fascists in the US and I don't see any compelling evidence that they have a lot of power. For the former, even events like Charlottesville, which was marketed as like ComicCon for white nationalists, had on it's best day like a thousand white nationalists present. That's people who flew and drove in from all over the country to attend and that's all they got. A thousand. And I mean fuck ComicCon is drawing in 167,000 attendees annually. If comic geeks are a 167x larger demographic than fascists I find it kind of hard to be concerned over the latter. 

In terms of power I see a lot of people citing the horrible violence that white nationalists/fascists inflict, but the ""power"" to make headlines by shooting up a store or school or whatever doesn't really translate to power over the society at large. I mean for example Muslim extremists have a similar body count to that of white nationalist extremists, but it would be asinine to argue that Muslim fundamentalists hold a lot of power over the US.

I don't want to make this a big wall of spam lol but I kind of have to due to requirements. So sorry if I seem spammy? I guess I will do my best to explain more.

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't know how to word this without sounding like **the ultimate douche bag.** Lol. Basically as some of you know some people are kind of... predisposed I'd say? to some risks with pregnancy like postpartum depression, pregnancy diabetes, miscarriage, and way more. All of which are unhealthy and sad y'know. And I feel like although it shouldn't happen it very obviously does, those things. But with all these in mind, and genetics, I feel like some women shouldn't have babies ***for the sake of their own health***. No offense to them, I know adoption and IVF can be very very pricey and a long process. But I also believe, as a part of this whole thing that women are valued at much more than caretakers and baby makers. It shouldn't (and kind of is made now) as not our only goal. Humans are multi faceted in nature, in purpose, and making a child shouldn't be the first thing on our minds especially if detrimental to our health.

&amp;#x200B;

A quick note that if you wish to have kids you should still weigh the risks in any case because our life is just as precious and special as that baby you want to have potentially. A lot of people are pro-life and pro-choice, etc but shouldn't your own matter too? I hear so much views and discussion around those two polarizing views, on adoption, on the Border crisis with kids in cages but I'd be damned if the first person we don't focus on health wise is our selves or those around us. Lol not trying to be a mega hater at all, I am just confused. Also I was going to mention earlier but a big factor that is probably causing this healthwise is Obesity and the associated risk factors at-large. (Cancer, Cardiac issues, etc) And I hear obesity can skyrocket your risk for gestational diabetes which I don't think is good for the infant either. Also, worldwide a big thing is alcohol and drug usage, to each their own I guess? But literally everyone knows what that does to you and the baby both. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like, take me for example. This whole view might be biased due to me having this issue (and, no, before you ask please don't say I'm secretly **jealous, angry, or vitriolous** against those who have the chance,) I have a rare disorder which basically renders me infertile. Like I cannot possibly ever have kids. And like I had stated before adoption is expensive and out of my budget, and I do not plan to get married. But anyways. I know how Reddit is with being horrible and placing blame on everyone so I just wanted to comment this before anyone attacks. I think if we also have more sex education (Like, proper, a changed view on it), better ways to get motivated for eating healthy and getting fit that might help too, at least some. Because I will admit myself I was eating disordered and still am to a degree, I believe many in America are this way.

cmv: Feminism Isn't Needed In Western Society.," I think that feminism isn't necessary in places that have Western influence (e.g USA, UK, etc). I just want to start off by saying that feminism was made for women's LEGAL rights.

In the 1920's, women couldn't vote and feminism helped change that. However, it isn't helping again because it has nothing to help. We can agree that old feminism is different from modern feminism. Now, women have a lot of rights in Western society.

But, does feminism really need to shit on men's rights? **It has to in order to stay alive.** If you humanize your enemy, you dehumanize yourself. That means the feminists have to shit on men to make themselves look good.

A feminist might argue : "" Women have less rights than men!"". That's false. Name one **legal** privilege that a **man** has that a **woman** does not. There isn't any. However women have the privileges of :

1. Not being required to sign up for Selective Service
2. Being more likely of gaining custody of children from biased courts
3. In California, a woman can proclaim a man the father of her child even when the man is not. The man has only a month to prove otherwise. If he does not, the court claims him the father, even if he proves it later.
4. In Kansas, a woman can take an unconscious man's semen, impregnate herself, and sue him for child support
5. A woman can rape a man/ boy and sue them for child support
6. Can accuse a man of rape and when proven that she lied, she'll face little to no consequences.
7. Can receive less time for an equivalent crimes

As you can see, women have 7 LEGAL privileges that men don't have. But...

A feminist might argue : "" Women are being oppressed by men!"". And you'd be partially right. See, women ARE oppressed but not in Western society. However, they are oppressed in Africa and the Middle east.

1. There is no such thing as a ""patriarchy"". Women are more likely to vote than men in the US. If women don't like men in office, then they could just vote for a female.
2. Rape culture doesn't exist. If we live in a rape culture, why can the mere accusation of rape ruin a man's life? If a man is accused of rape, everyone will start hating him. But if a man did commit rape, we don't go and praise him. We lock him up with the big dogs.
3. Man-spreading isn't real. For anyone of you that don't know, the testicles are literally between the legs. I'm not crushing my balls for you.
4. Wage gap is fake. The way that the wage gap is presented is BS. But if the wage gap was real, it still would be stupid. If companies can get away with paying women less than men, wont they just hire women? Do you believe that companies are such boys clubs that they care more about being sexist than profits?

CMV: Rachel Dolezal deserves to be respected as a member of the black community.,"I was suddenly reminded of Rachel Dolezal once again with this whole shitstorm about Joe Biden saying if you vote for Trump, you ""ain't black"".

So I actually used to have a podcast and I did an episode about Rachel Dolezal once. I think a lot of the people who were quick to mock her haven't actually looked into her history.

In case you haven't heard about this story, Rachel Dolezal is a white woman who pretended to be half-black for many years (half-black is the only way she could have fooled anyone, judging by her appearance), she claimed to be the mixed-race daughter of a couple from the south who was forced to flee to Idaho, and then later Spokane, in order to escape prosecution after assaulting a racist policeman.

After moving north, she became heavily involved in civil rights activism, taught classes about african-american studies, and was even elected president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP, in addition to being chosen for the Spokane police ombudsman commission in the wake of the black lives matter movement, since she was seen as such an important figure there.

She created art having to do with civil rights, including a fountain sculpture that was installed in downtown Spokane, which was then auctioned off to benefit the human rights education institute. By all accounts she was a fervent, tireless, and prominent figure in the fight for racial equality.

But then she was exposed in a very uncomfortable interview in which Rachel walks off camera after being asked questions about her parentage. The video went viral and led to national attention of the story and the downward spiral of Rachel Dolezal's life.

A national news feeding frenzy occurred, with a vast majority of journalists and commentators mocking her relentlessly. She was fired from all positions and essentially became an outcast in society.

She has applied for more than 100 jobs, but no one will hire her, not even to stock supermarket shelves. She applied for a position at the university where she used to teach, and says she was interviewed by former colleagues who pretended to have no recollection of having even met her. The only work she has been offered is reality TV, and porn. She has changed her name on all her legal documents, but is still recognized wherever she goes. People point at her and laugh, she says.

To be fair, some of this could be exaggerated - she has been known to lie after all. But judging by the way society at large mocked her, I believe it.

If you've ever seen the episode of Black Mirror titled “White Christmas”, this might sound very familiar. SPOILER ALERT! A former prisoner is released on the condition that he will be unable to communicate with anyone, and nobody will be able to communicate with him. The similarities are eerie.

Does she deserve this fate?

She was apparently able to convince many black people that she understood and shared their struggles, that she was one of them. She was democratically elected president of the NAACP chapter.

When she was 5 years old, **her parents adopted 4 black children**. This apparently had a profound effect on her, as you might expect, and in her own words, she never thought of herself as white after that. **She even has a doll that her aunt made for her, and the doll appears to be african-american**. Considering this history, is it really that hard to believe that she may genuinely feel that she is a black person?

Some have made the argument that since she is not truly black, she cannot understand the struggle of being black in America. But I would ask those people, what does being black mean to you? Is it more important that she actually be black? Or is it more important that she has **lived her entire life around black culture, chose to educate college students about african-american studies, fight for civil rights every day, and become a well respected member of the black community in several facets**? The answer seems simple to me.

If we as a society can respect the often half-hearted attempt that certain groups of people put forth with unusual identities, which ""society"" does, why is it so wrong for society to respect an entire life lived around this identity? Caitlyn Jenner won woman of the year. Rachel Dolezal can't get a job.

# On the other hand, we have a person working as staff at Twitch who [identifies as a deer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL_LUy7LItA) and feels very empowered in their position. As a society we respect this person, but not Rachel Dolezal.

During Rachel's tenure at the NAACP, she was actually officially recognized by the organization for quote, “revitalizing the chapter”.

She taught college courses about african american studies for sixteen years total (8 in Idaho, 8 in WA) and only got fired when the scandal arose.

Rachel has a Master of Fine Arts degree, which is a postgraduate degree requiring 2-3 years of study, although since the degree is in fine arts, the student is only required to produce works of art such as photography, filmmaking, dance, theatre, or other performing arts. In other words, the degree that got Rachel Dolezal her 8-year college professorship required no actual academic knowledge or research. However, I think it's safe to assume that she did have to perform academic research and gain knowledge in order to teach these classes. If she didn't, you have to wonder what the content of these classes even consists of.

Let's think about this a little more: what was/is her end-game? If she really doesn't feel like a black woman, if she really didn't care about racial equality and justice, if she really didn't care about african-american studies, why did her whole life seem to revolve around these issues? Was she being paid very well? No, she was actually not. This is documented.

Was she planning to take her accumulated wealth and flee the country one day, ironically adopting a new identity and living out her life in the Bahamas, or something like that? Or

Here's the big question I really want to ask you guys:

What if she plans to keep up this life until her dying day?

And if that is done, what, really, is the difference between someone living this life legitimately, and someone living this life while keeping their true intentions secret? At what point does the line blur? At what point does a mask become your true face? At what point does a white woman pretending to be a black woman, become a black woman?

But hey, maybe I'm too tolerant for this issue. CMV.",2020-05-24 19:28:38,changemyview

CMV: Women who want abortions should be allowed to have them. Having an abortion is also completely immoral.,"Before you read this, I'd like to point out that I am a non-religious female in her twenties. Just struggling to make sense of popular nonsensical ideas. First off, I'd like to start with my conclusion that having an abortion is immoral in most any circumstance. That includes: 

1) women who are raped 
2) women whose lives are in danger with a complicated pregnancy
3) and any other reason someone might have for wanting an abortion

The only circumstance that I see can be justified is one where the fetus is going to die anyways AND the mother will die unless the fetus is aborted. 

If murder is immoral, then abortion is immoral. For all those who think life doesn't start until birth- I'll admit that is such a great excuse to help you feel more comfort when you struggle with cognitive dissonance (when someone has two conflicting beliefs and ends up choosing one over the other because it is more comfortable to live that way). The reality of it is, that fetus WILL have a future unless you destroy that opportunity. The only thing stopping the fetus from living a life just like you is you deciding you're more important. ""They can't feel pain up until a certain point"" is not a good excuse. Does that mean it's okay to murder someone under anesthesia because they can't feel pain? No! You'd be taking away their future that they will most certainly have.

1) For women who are raped: I don't see how abortion is justifiable if you also believe that murder is immoral. Why would it be acceptable for a woman to chose to end the life of an innocent fetus because someone else did wrong to her?

2) For women who want an abortion because their pregnancy puts their life in danger: it is NOT the fetus's fault that it was created. So why would it be okay for you to decide that your life is more valuable than the fetus? This goes for rape victims whose lives are in danger, too. Yes, it is terrible for one to be raped, but it's not the fetus's fault.  Why would that make it okay for you to chose to murder someone? (This whole situation sucks and if it happened to me then I can't say I wouldn't be tempted to have an abortion. But I still think it's morally wrong.)

3) For any other reason someone might want to have an abortion: You aren't ready? You don't want to be a parent? It would ruin your life? These are all completely selfish reasons because again, none of these justify murdering an innocent fetus.  

With all that being said, I also think people should be free to do whatever they want. That doesn't mean what they do is classified as moral. It just means people should be free. That also includes people who want to publically shame those who are pro abortion. If a women has an abortion- i think she should accept the consequences of being shamed for it-just like how murderers are shamed when they are caught. I also think it is theft and slavery for people who do not want to support abortions to have their tax money go towards abortion services.

I am saddened that I live in a world where people are so selfish to act on the thought that their lives are more important than someone else's. ""My body my choice"" is such a corrupt way of thinking. It's literally not just your body anymore. It's the fetus's body too.",2020-05-24 19:18:05,changemyview
CMV: Fetishes and sexual orientation are functionally identical.,"So I think that fetishes can, for all intents and purposes, be treated the same way we treat sexuality. Whether they're the same on a neurological basis or not is irrelevant. 

My points:

1. Fetishes can be neither gained nor lost willingly. It happens or it doesn't. You can't make yourself not interested in, say, feet any more than you can make yourself not interested in men/women.
2. Fetishes exist along a spectrum of strength, much like sexuality. You can *require* a fetish to obtain sexual satisfaction or it may be optional--like somebody can be pansexual, bisexual, have a preference but be pansexual, or be exclusively interested in one gender.
3. Engaging in sex involving your partner of choice or fetish of choice is inherently amoral. So long as you abide by requiring informed consent from every party involved, it is not immoral. This includes fetishes that would inherently violate informed consent; the fact that they can't be acted out fully doesn't mean their existence is immoral.",2020-05-24 18:55:54,changemyview
CMV: Nothingness is better than existence.,"This idea has been in my mind since I was very young, but a certain CMV post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/gprrr4/cmv_the_god_of_the_bible_is_horrifically_immoral/) reminded me of it today.

I was born and raised a Theravada Buddhist. Up until I was about 10-11 years old, I followed the teachings and rituals of Buddhism regularly. Then, I started learning about other religions and beliefs, and it made me doubt whether any of these beliefs are true to begin with.

Now I am what people would call agnostic. However, there is one concept in Buddhism that I do agree with. Instead of having heaven or hell as the endpoint of our journey in life, Buddhism believes in nothingness. The endpoint that everyone should strive to achieve is nothingness, as there would no longer be suffering, physically or mentally, in nothingness. I believe this concept is called Nibbana (if I remember correctly).

Now, I have quite a number of friends who disagree with me. The main argument raised by them would revolve around how ""human experience"" is invaluable and the most precious thing, but then who is determining whether this ""human experience"" is invaluable? I mean, to me the concept of nothingness is a perfectly acceptable alternative to our existence which is plagued with suffering.

I guess my main point here is: Nothingness is better than existence as it means there would be no suffering, and no suffering by itself is better than experiencing life and its joys while needing to experience suffering as well. CMV?",2020-05-24 18:43:15,changemyview
CMV: Population Growth is Bad for Most Pepple.,"The way I've mostly been thinking about this is how much harder it is to get a job in the 21st century compared to virtually any other time. You have to absolutely spam employers, go through hundreds of interviews, and compete with literally everyone in the entire world with similar skillsets looking for a job. In order to be competitive you have to go for a niche within a niche and corner it. To be rich you have to be better than literally millions of people at something or you have to corner a tiny market. Guess which one is way easier? And cornering a tiny niche is almost like becoming the best among a much smaller group of people, which made me think the world would probably be a much better place if there wasn't so much damn competition. Even if you try your absolute best you might very well be better than 99% of people but there is still millions of people better than you.

Essentially, the value of something is determined by its supply and demand, right? Well if labor was much lower in demand, no millions of chinese and indian people willing to get paid a penny a year to do a skilled trade, labor would be valued much more. In addition, human life in general would be valued a lot more. I think it is not an unfair thing to say that much earlier in human life when we lived in clans and family units instead of huge cities and suburbs people were valued more and treated as individuals. 

People always say ""well it's not a zero sum game!"" and I think that saying is a load of horse shit. Of course it is. There are 3 medals in the olympics. Gold, silver, and bronze. No 4th place, yet the number of skilled competitors rises constantly. There are 2,095 billionaires in the world. 46.8 million millionaires in the world. Yet there are over 7.5 BILLION people in the world. Sounds like a shit game to me.

Here's a display of the problem of evil for those not aware of it : ""Is God willing to prevent evil but not able ? Then he is not all powerful. Is he able but not willing ? Then he is evil.

-(According to 2007 figures) Nearly 9 million children under the age of 5 die every year, 70% of them due to very preventable causes.

We live in a cruel, unforgiving, unjust, and absolutely brutal world that any omniscient, omnipotent and omni-benevolent being would be absolutely discredited if ever associated with it. I don't think the Christian God is good, I find him repulsive, mean spirited, unfair, and undoubtedly evil. 

I will elaborate further on why I think that's the case in my responses to the common responses as to not repeat myself, seeing as this is already a very long read. 

***1- You're just being emotional***

This implies that being upset over the evil in the world is somehow irrational or a weak point to suggest that evil shouldn't exist. Why is it that we move towards fixing issues in the world, then ? Partly because we are emotionally inclined to make a better world for ourselves and those around us, even if not all of us do. Better... That's an interesting word. 

***2- Where do you get your morality, then ?***

Easy, I get my morality from the Bible. Wait, But isn't this what I'm criticizing ? No, I'm criticizing the God of the Bible's morality (in terms of his actions), and not necessarily the Bible's morality. Most of the old testament's brutish laws have been overruled by the new testament and Jesus' fulfillment of the law (and thereby ending the need for it to be followed, see the entire letter to the Galatians) so, in current form, I have no issue with the Bible's laid plan for morality. The issue is with the God who doesn't follow his own rules, which bring us to...

***3- God is under no obligation to follow any moral rules***

This is exactly what a dictator's propaganda sounds like; Calling someone, who is so obviously awful, a wonderful example, and even a model to be followed, while their actions say the opposite. It is expected that the people's disillusionment with the picture they are sold on would be enough to sabotage any critical thinking. Here's where this falls apart for the God of the Bible; 1 Corinthians 13 (AMP)...

V4 : ""...Love is not jealous or envious."" Yet Yahweh is jealous, very destructively so, in fact. Kind of like an abusive spouse. (Deuteronomy 6:15, Exodus 34:14, Exodus 20: 4-6)

V5 : ""it is not provoked [nor overly sensitive and easily angered]; it does not take into account a wrong endured."" Yet Yahweh clearly has anger issues and loves to describe his furious rage in meticulous detail. (Isaiah 30:27-28, Exodus 32:9,10, Ezekiel 25:17) He also has no issue with keeping records of wrongs and remembering wrongdoings even in someone's children, and grandchildren. (Numbers 14:18, Exodus 20:5, also the whole Bible because original sin, in case you want to call the other examples ""righteous anger"")

And that's just two verses from only ONE chapter that has God demanding a standard be set for all Christians that he himself doesn't come close to following, but also explicitly opposes as evident by his actions. Even though these are descriptions of his core characteristic, which is love (1 John 4:8). But what if I'm wrong... What if actually-

***4- God uses evil for good/God is purifying or disciplining us.***

Well, if this is enough to convince you, I have a question for you. Could God have achieved the same exact good/discipline/purification through means that don't involve directly or indirectly causing (or using/permitting) suffering ? No ? Then he's not omnipotent. Yes ? Then he's not all good, or else he would've done that instead. Applying this response is like using a Canon to send a patient to the hospital, or using a flamethrower to more efficiently take off your shirt. In other words; this would clearly be either the work of: an amateur, an idiot, or a sadist.  

***5- Well, that's just the old testament/a different covenant/a different stage of gradual revelation.***

God should not be accounting for people's culture or lack of understanding by causing unbelievable amounts of harm, then turning around and calling Jesus a full revelation of himself or saying the older covenants weren't complete, or the testaments changed. Stoning is not okay now, but it was back then. And so is this discussion (Leviticus 24:13-16), which if I had back then would've had me on the receiving end of a barrage of rocks and stones, thrown by bloodthirsty tribal people who have been raised to believe this is the most moral thing to do, until I arrive at a very painful death.

That which is not okay now, according to God, never should've been. Jesus makes Yahweh sound like his drunk psychopathic uncle. That's just how jarring and drastic and irreconcilable the morality of the new testament is with the old. You cannot, with good conscience, call them similar, let alone the same person. 

***6- Satan is the god/king of the earth, blame him.***

How can I ? Let's not forget that God created Satan knowing what he would become and never chose to destroy him, even though he is fully capable of doing it. Not when he falls, or tries to interfere in Adam and Eve's choice, or after he successfully interferes, or at any point since creation until now. Satan is clearly a major source of harm, so why not just chain him up in his infinite torture basement that he's bound to go to, anyway ? 

The only supposed explanation I've seen to this point is a link between (1 Corinthians 6:3) and (Hebrews 1:14) that claims the reason is that fallen angels (Satan included) were supposed to serve us, and therefore it's us who should judge them, not God, that's why they remain free for now. That's like a doctor refusing to close up a patient's potentially fatal wound because his father isn't there to watch. The least to be said about it is that it's infuriatingly cruel. 

Satan only exists and continues to operate and commit all sorts of evils and atrocities because God allows it, God isn't just an accomplice here, he's the Mastermind. And if you're among those saying God can't do anything about it because he can't interfere in a domain that's not his, or break his own rules.. I hope you realize you're calling God stupid. Because if he knew these rules would one day limit his goodness, or ability to be the most good, he shouldn't have made them in the first place. And don't even get me started on Job. 

***7- I guess you'll just have to blame Adam and Eve!/we live in a fallen world.***

Again, you're pointing at the wrong person for blame. What Adam and Eve did is that they ate a fruit. The major idea there is that God put a ""do not eat"" label on there, and a promise that they'll die if they eat from it. So, who sets the consequences ? God. Who constructed the mechanism on which original sin operates, thereby stripping us of choice and tying the nature of our existence to our ancestors' mistakes ? God. Who could've made a system in which all of this wouldn't have happened ? God. 

The fact that a world exists where evil overflows and spreads like a cancer into everything and everyone is something God saw eternity past, and still, he went through with it. He saw every child raped, every man and woman enslaved, every soldier shot, all those bedridden while disease eats them alive, all those afflicted with crippling mental illnesses, disaster permeating through our planet to the very core,  yet he remained unflinching in his will to make this world. To go through with this creation project, while entirely aware of the horrific downside. He should've done better, he should've known better, there is no excuse. 

***8- What about free will !?***

""Free will"", what a joke. I see people using free will as an answer like it's some sort of an Ace in the hole. If you will it to fly and jump off a building, will you fly ? No. If you make a choice to be a millionaire and snap your fingers and will really hard, will it happen ? No. So, there are natural limitations to our choices, aren't there ? Who set those limitations there and constructed the laws of reality ? God. So why is it that we have a choice available to completely and utterly destroy ourselves with the previous knowledge that we would make it ? 

Our free will is already limited, couldn't God have gone just this one step further ? Death should never have been an option. To grant it is a vile affliction, a senseless brutality, a cruel and sadistic joke. You wouldn't get mad at the pilot for not letting you open the window to an airplane, he clearly has more concern for your safety than your absolute freedom. Would our free will be lacking had we been denied the choice of death ? Indeed. But think of how much pain and suffering and destruction and agony humanity would've been spared had God simply done this, plus, it's already limited, so what difference does it make ? 

You might say that death is just the logical opposite of God. Well, according to whom ? Whose rule is this ? Who could've made reality into something completely different where there's no need for eternal conscious torture that is too brutal a punishment for anything imaginable ? God. According to Jesus, most people that have ever lived will go to hell for eternity (Matthew 7:13-14), this is a truly unenviable world we live in, and if this is the best possible one, then God should've known better and not created at all. He is clearly too hostile and dangerous to sustain a good creation. 

He is a prideful and unrelenting figure, whose tyranny exceeds any of those we have in our history, he takes himself way too seriously, that's why free will to us allowed our death, and the consequence of eating the fruit wasn't much lighter and more reasonable, it is how one is executed for daring to follow one's nature, and be imperfect. To question or oppose Yahweh, that's death, that's how he likes it to be. People have done many evils in the world, but remember, this could've been better, and could've been prevented from before it ocurred. And there's only one world creating, all powerful, time traveller that we know about, his name is Yahweh. 

***9- God doesn't really know everything/isn't all powerful and that's okay.***

No it isn't. It also directly contradicts (1 John 3:20) which explicitly says He is all knowing, and (Jeremiah 32:17, Job 42:2, Matthew 19:26) that say he is all powerful. 

***10- This is God's judgement for people's evildoing.***

So, let me get this straight... You're telling me that the creator of the universe is not only concerned with petty squabbles and territorial disputes, but has no better solutions for them than chopping eachother's heads off ? For what ? Saying he isn't God ? Yahweh here emulates a child throwing his toy against the wall for refusing to say ""I love you"" back. And what of the children that were slaughtered, what was their crime ? (1 Samuel 15:2-3) or perhaps it was because they sacrificed them, so he ordered them killed too, anyway ? 

What of the Virgin girls ""given"" with the many horrible and vile implications of that term, given to men who murdered their entire families! (Numbers 31:17-18) does God stop this mess ? Perhaps you haven't been paying attention, this type of God demands a portion of the girls as tribute, then leaves the rest to the men, did you expect him to speak in their favor, perhaps ? (Numbers 31:25-40) who without a second thought commands men to kill their brothers or neighbors or partners (Exodus 32:27-29) 

Then he has the gall and audacity to say he doesn't enjoy the deaths of those who die. (Ezekiel 18:32) all the while delighting in graphic descriptions of ruin and genocide (Isaiah 34:2-3), does this sound fair to you ? Is this someone you would worship, if not for the threat of hell ? Because you genuinely love them ? Even if some of those killed had deserved death, who is really to blame here ? Who made them and put them into such a world and culture and time ? Playing chess against the fundamental idea of opposing him, with sentient beings as pawns made in his own image, the image he violates by countless incitements of senseless violence, within the context of a creation in which the instance of their failure was not only expected, but inevitable. 

***11- it doesn't matter, you won't care about any of this in heaven.***

That's like someone stabbing you, then stitching you up, and paying your hospital bills. That doesn't explain or justify the stabbing, though. 

***12- you've done evil too, what makes you think you can judge God ?/what's a better creation, then ?***

Frankly, I don't have to be a professional chef to say your food is burnt, and therefore awful, even if I don't know how to fix it or have a better recipe. I don't have to give you a better scenario for creation just because I'm saying this is terrible, the burden of figuring out a better way is on God, not me. Plus, you criticize all the other religions' gods with meticulous detail and ruthless questioning, even though theirs also claims to be an infinite God. Unsurprisingly, that defense works for neither of you. 

***13- We don't know, we may never know, our tiny brains can't comprehend God's mysterious ways!***

This is, by far, the most popular one. I'm certain I've unintentionally answered this somewhere up there, that's how absurd this response is. But let me add to your agony in reading this whole thing, why don't you; This response is nothing short of profoundly insulting. This is an author apologizing for his character's poorly described motivations and shrouding him in a veil of mystery to shield his shortcomings. 

Put simply; God owes us an explanation. We're his greatest ever creation, he apparently loves us so much as to die for us, he gave us tons of books that divulge tons of information about himself, yet he sees it appropriate to NOT express his motivations fully ? What does his being so mysterious achieve, exactly ? Why not let us in on it, make it known to us exactly what he wants us to do and why ? Wouldn't this be a greater motivator to follow him, because he's transparent and therefore trustworthy ? A lot of Christians reject this ""mysterious ways"" thing, yet some hold on to it, and it's honestly sad.  

***14- The character of Jesus redeems Yahweh's***

If a law abiding citizen claims to be the same person as a mass murdering maniac, that doesn't redeem the mass murdering maniac. And even if it was proven, that still doesn't excuse it, no matter what the murderer's intentions or true purposes were, he is still a murderer. If the God of the old testament was put on trial in a modern court, he'd be given a million life sentences. Not that I think Jesus is perfect or agree with his plan by sacrificing himself to himself, but that's a topic for another discussion. Point is, it's too much of a strain on any person with a conscience to call them the same person, not that it makes Yahweh look any better. 




Whew, that took a while. So, this is my case against the Christian God, his nature, his so called goodness, his misguided actions, and his absolute disaster of a creation. I've shown why he is either an impotent fool, an all knowing villain, or perhaps just an apathetic and distant deity. If you have a better response to the problem of evil or would like to further explain any of the responses I responded to, feel free to do so. I'm open to correction and civil conversation. But, I will not compromise unless I am convinced, and will give reasons for why I'm unconvinced, if that's the case.",2020-05-24 15:40:35,changemyview
CMV: Taxation is theft,"I hold to this view because I think that your generosity should come from the goodness of your heart, not by the mandate of the government. I think it would be feasable for countries to operate on donations and revenue created through tourism, mining, etc. I have always believed this, in part because of the influence of my parents who are very much minarchists. I think it is time for me to look at different views and formulate my own conclusion. What might change my view is a respectful, solid argument. I find those have been the most convincing",2020-05-24 15:32:26,changemyview
CMV: Sicilians killed labour unions which killed the American Dream,"Before accusations of racism come flying in I am Ashkenazi Jewish was raised in the north east US next to warring Irish american and Italian american stereotypes. I love Italians was practically raised by them. I spent last summer in Palermo Sicily and it was incredible, STILL

We used to have a stronger and more united working class in this country. Everything we take for granted now like federal holidays, the weekend, public schooling was paid for in blood by our striking forefathers.

When organized crime mostly propagated by Sicilian immigrants was on its meteoric rise due to prohibition the next racket was infiltrating labour unions. This was done so effectively that unions became synonymous with mafia climaxing with the death of Jimmy Hoffa as portrayed in ""The Irishmen.""

In order to effectively stop these organized criminal enterprises the US passed into law in 1970 the RICO act allowing individuals associated with a criminal enterprise to be charged even if they were never there in person. The resulting mass arrests further lowered confidence and the power of the labour unions to the state they are in today.

Today only 6.2% of the private workforce is unionized. Income inequality has been steadily rising and wages have remained stagnant since the 70's. The old titans of industry the robber barons of the early 20th century still exist but we do not have the tools our forefathers used in the past to fight them. There are many reasons for this but in my mind I will always hold a slight grudge against Sicilians and also my people the Jews.",2020-05-24 15:24:17,changemyview
CMV: If you smoke tobacco to the point of addiction you're incapable of critical thinking.,"Never in my life have I come across something as nonsensical from a risk/reward perspective and practised by so many people as smoking cigarettes so my natural conclusion is that those people are simply incapable of objective reasoning. 

I'm going to draw up a pros and cons list to illustrate the basis of my view: 

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: 

It releases endorphins (except when you're addicted it only maintains your normal level of endorphins)

People find it relaxing and a good way to take breaks from things (except it's perfectly reasonable to just step out for some fresh air once in a while without being a smoker)

It's a social activity which can form friendships 

It looks cool (?)

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: 

The smell 

Tar buildup in your surroundings 

It's expensive

Weakened palette and smell, making food and drink less enjoyable

Withdrawals throughout the day

It will make you miserable when trying to quit

Makes you less physically attractive and able

Health detriments: It increases your chances of having a stroke, increases your blood pressure, increases the chances of blood clots, irreparably damages your lungs, makes you very likely to die of cancer, weakens oesophagus causing reflux, bad breath and mouth hygiene, reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to your skin making it deteriorate a lot faster, causes male impotence and infertility in both sexes, weakens bones

CMV: Cyclists should pay for road registration and insurance,"Before all the cyclists who are responsible people who choose to ride to work instead of taking up space on the road and contributing to congestion with cars, not to mention the obvious health benefits of the regular strenuous exercise involved, please hear me out.

In order for vehicles to use the road (at least in Australia, where I'm typing from), certain things are expected of you.

# Compulsory Insurance

All users are required to have at-least third-party insurance in order to ensure that property damage is largely the least-concern of any fender bender, broken telegraph pole, or startling a poor lady crossing the street and making her drop her $3.50 Slurpee onto the pavement when you accidentally left the gear in reverse (story for another time). As far as I know, bicycles aren't subjected to this, and I'd feel pretty shitty for a poor cyclist who is involved in an accident and ends up causing significant property damage because they accidentally dented a custom paint job on a '84 DeLorean because a bee decided to pick that moment to fly directly into their face. 

# Road Levy

No idea how this works in other countries, but in Australia at least, every licence holder pays a levy to the state when they renew their registration. The fee is tacked onto the cost of the rego, and is meant to go toward road maintenance costs (in theory). So the logic supposedly goes in the realm of heavier and therefore more built-up areas have more expensive road levies. 

# Registration

This is like the above, but for slightly different reasons. It's less about the vehicle paying for the privilege of using the road (although in reality, it totally is) and more to do with ensuring that the vehicle is ""road worthy"". This basically (in theory)  ensures that less defective vehicles that are unsafe to be in public settings are in public settings. Furthermore it makes it mighty easy to track and prosecute road users when they break the law if they all are mandated to have their vehicle identifiable by a visible ID tag in the form of a license plate. I feel that if a cyclist expects the laws and obligations of the road to apply to them, they should be required to pay and have their ""vehicle"" identifiable just like any other road user. 

# tl;dr

I have the opinion that if a cyclist insists on being on the road, they should be required to comply with the following:

* Pay for registration and have a clearly displayed license plate
* Pass and carry a license
* Pay for other associated road-use taxes/levies/tolls, etc, although at a vastly reduced cost to reflect the proportion of impact on road upkeep. 
* Pay for insurance in-case of accidents
* All cyclists that choose to not use the road should have alternative infrastructure available. If the infrastructure is not available yet, then the above should be plenty to go toward funding said infrastructure. 
* Mandatorily wear helmets, just like scooters/motorcycle users. This is already a law in Australia, but it still amazes me how many people I see barrelling down the street with the helmet dangling from the handlebars like a tacky ornament instead of safety equipment. It should be enforced, and you countries that don't even have helmet laws (looking at YOU, Germany.) should have them.",2020-05-24 14:18:14,changemyview
CMV: Vegans encouraging people to eat vegan is equally as valid as a non-smoker encouraging people not to smoke.,"I understand that some people probably latch onto hating vegans just because they think it's hip and makes them look cool to their friends or on the internet. But overall, I don't think there's any valid reason to wholesale disregard the message. 

Now to get out in front of a reply I'm expecting a lot of: smoking has a stronger scientific consensus than plant-based diets. I accept this, and replies that focus solely on this are off-topic to this CMV. I am making the following assumptions and would ask that have any debate within the bounds of the assumptions:

1. Vocal vegans believe genuinely that their diet is more healthy for the person and more ethical for the animals being factory farmed.

2. Their intent in encouraging others to go vegan is more important than whether or not there is 100% scientific consensus.

As far as I see it, vegans (including vocal minority vegans) are putting themselves in a tough spot to do a public service even if it is unpopular. I think this is equally valid and deserves no more hate than encouraging people not to smoke. I don't think they deserve the hate. But CMV!",2020-05-24 13:58:32,changemyview
CMV: I think Hookup Culture masks mental health problems and we should stop acceptig it for the weelbeing of people.,"So, i've been thinking about Hookup Culture and I pretty much cimented some views related to it by now that i want to discuss and evaluate here. My approach to the problem is different from what i have seen. I'm not that interested in the consequences of Hookup Culture, I'm rather focused on the causes. \*\*So, my real opinion on this topic is going to be lent on C), all the rest is A) an Introduction where i think about what is Hookup Culture and B) a reflexion about the consequences of it.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

OBS: When i talk about casual sex or no-strings-attached I'm talking about mainly one-night-stands and FWB and, in some cases, open-relationships and polyamory.

&amp;#x200B;

So, let's go for it:

&amp;#x200B;

A) First, we have to discuss what is Hookup Culture. There is this idea that the no-strings-attached sex is something that just happens and is not rooted in our contemporary culture. You can say that people hooked up in the past too, and you can even point the ""Hippie Free Love Movement"" to assert it. Yes, i understand that, but there are a lot of differences form the past hookups and the ones we are dealing with today:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Of course our parents did take part on hookups. The difference was that it was not considered the norm. One was expected to have a relationship with emotional connection and usually casual sex was done withouth the media buzz we have now. The difference is that now casual sex is pushed by media and other forms of propaganda. In the last decades we had movies as ""Friends With Benefits"" and ""No Strings Attached"". It is normal to joke about this kind of approach to sex. We call it ""Modern Love"". In our University Campus, teens are expected to have casual sex. Lisa Wade's \*American Hookup: The New Culture of Sex on Campus\* shows this in its plenitude. Liberal Feminism and the sex-positive ideology is pushing this type of sex at full speed. 

2. The ""Free Love Movement"" was not just about sex but about emotions too. Love was expected. As Lisa Wade's book shows, and major studies - or even another book by Dinna Freitas, \*The End of Sex: How Hookup Culture is Leaving a Generation Unhappy, Sexually Unfulfilled, and Confused About Intimacy\* \\- our current casual sex society is all about sex withouth emotion. Is more a mechanical act in search of an orgasm that a connection between human beings. In fact, people that participate in this type of sex are expected to repress their feelings. Lisa Wade has a chapter in her book that deals with the position of a person after hooking up - a friend becames and acquaintence, an acquaintence becames a stranger. We are not connecting people - although we think we are connecting them by sex, with all the sex-positive agenda -, we are, rather, disconnecting people, leading to a number society.

&amp;#x200B;

B) The fact that Liberal Feminism has been the main ideology that pushed casual sex for women is something that makes no sense for me. Psychology Studies ( \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPO2YvrkJo&amp;list=PLlMwRMazmd1sXxtPeNkVliO5P-RPkvqaH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPO2YvrkJo&amp;list=PLlMwRMazmd1sXxtPeNkVliO5P-RPkvqaH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s)\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPO2YvrkJo&amp;list=PLlMwRMazmd1sXxtPeNkVliO5P-RPkvqaH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPO2YvrkJo&amp;list=PLlMwRMazmd1sXxtPeNkVliO5P-RPkvqaH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s)) ) have shown that women are the ones that gather more suffering from this type of sex. The way the orgasm happens on women and men is very different. Men - i'm being general here - have a much more easy time orgasming from casual sex than women. And why? Because men are much more visual and women tend to have a harder time getting to the point, as a lot of senses are used here. The orgasm for women is much more mental than physical. The orgasm form men is, too, much better when mental than just physical. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, women can get pregnant if the contraceptive fails, and the partner will not be there to help dealing with this. On the other hands, we have STDs, that can be spread to both, as one is getting sexual with a person that is not that intimate and one does not know what is this person sexual history and if everythings fine.

&amp;#x200B;

We can then talk about how casual sex pushes social ideas that should be cut out. For instance, women are viewed as trophies for men. If a man has a lot of casual sex he is viewed as an alpha male. Liberal Feminism failed here, as we are making women more masculine with the casual sex thing but, on the other hand, we are not making men more feminine. We are, in fact, pushing toxic masculinity through the roof.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of other consequences, but lets pass to the real problem for me:

&amp;#x200B;

C) The causes. I was introduced to this topic before talking with some of my friends that have this kind of approach to life and seeing some patterns that really made me afraid of what we are pushing as a society. I then started to search for more and i now have established a connection between this behavior and mental problems. I assume that:

&amp;#x200B;

""People who participate in Hookup Culture are struggling with some problems, that are related to their education - mommy and daddy problems - and, thus, led to fear of intimacy, self-esteem issues and the need for validation""

&amp;#x200B;

There is a post here on Reddit that talks of it from a female perspective:  \[[https://www.reddit.com/r/PinkpillFeminism/comments/ft2wdv/casual\\\_sex\\\_and\\\_hookup\\\_culture\\\_is\\\_one\\\_of\\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PinkpillFeminism/comments/ft2wdv/casual\_sex\_and\_hookup\_culture\_is\_one\_of\_the/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/PinkpillFeminism/comments/ft2wdv/casual\_sex\_and\_hookup\_culture\_is\_one\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PinkpillFeminism/comments/ft2wdv/casual_sex_and_hookup_culture_is_one_of_the/)) . I read it some days ago while thinking about what i already knew and there are some similarities. I'm going to present four people that were or are my friends and that expereince Hookup Culture and what i gathered from it:  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. \*\*Male, 30 years\*\* \\- This friend of mine was ending a master degrees on the same faculty i was. He usually would tell me how he enjoyed being single because he could be with whom he wanted and watch porn when he wanted withou felling he was being unfaithful. I didn't like this second idea at the time, but i presumed it was ok because it was a choice. Then, one day my friend got his diploma and he was so happy that he phoned me to have lunch with me. While lunching we talked about the ending of the degree and he told me he cannot talk to her mom because she could never understand it, has she didn't care that much for him and would not be happy with his accomplishment. He was sad about this. The truth is that my friend had problems with is parents - more the mom than the dad - and he was then fearful of having emotional intimacy with anyone because he though no one was going to care about him. Not being cared by his mom, he was searching for validation of other females, through sex. As sex nowadays is just sex, he was getting false validation and so he would never heal. He should go for a emotional intimate relationship, but he thought he was right by taking part on casual sex, as it was good for him and society said it was normal. However, he was sad and hopeless.

&amp;#x200B;

2. \*\*Female, 23 years -\*\* At some point i met a girl that was spontaneous and liberated in the feminist sense. She was very independent and didn't really cared much about what other people thought about her. I managed to sit with her to have a good talk, something that she was not used to because she would just meet the guy, be with him sexually and then go for the next one. We started talking about literature and a connection was built around it. Then, we talked about her sexual liberation and she was very proud because her life was good. Again, i didn't mind. However, in a future conversation, she revealed that she lived with her grandmother because her mother flew away from the realtionship with her father when she was young and her father couldn't handle her education. She still does not talk with her father because he is absent. So, i started joining the pieces. This girl was seeking her father approval through other males. She was doing this sexually because she was afraid that the male figures in their life would hurt her and then fly away. She could not get emotional attached to anyone. She was sick, but society was telling her she was liberated.

3. \*\*Male, 20 years -\*\* A long-term friend of mine opened up to our friends group about the way he feels bad for having lost his virginity with a much younger girl in a bar. I was shocked but he had his choice. Then, i started thinking about my friend. In the past two months we are doing a lot of video calls as we are isolated. In almost all of this calls, his mother goes into his room and yells at him, stating that he does nothing. He told us two weeks ago that he is sick of his mom because she is breaking his self-esteem. So i started putting the pieces together and the same happened here. My friend had to seek approval from a woman because he was not receiving care from his mother. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. \*\*Female, 28 years -\*\* This case was the one that really made me think about all this in perspective, because this person is really close to me. While i was knowing her, she told me about her hookups, open relationships and FWB. She seemed to be very proud of this because she was free to have sex when she want with whom she want. I'm currently dating this girl and things have changed. She opened herself and told me that most of the casual sex was not fulfilling and that she has to rethink her sexual health. Furthermore, she told me about how her father was absent and how she was the least popular girl in her friends group. The other girls of this group had mainly close relationships. She used to compete with her male friends to see who managed to get casual sex. She was replicating the problems i talked about in the other people: she was seeking physical approval from men because her father did not gave it to her; she was even competing with her male friends, because in her mind she had an idea that she would have to demonstrate them that she was worth and people cared about her. But none of these guys she was with cared for her really. However, she was afraid of intimacy, has she was afraid of being hurt and her self-esteem was lower than ever. She knew something was off with her but she didn't know what was because all this casual sex was viewed as normal and she was just too inside of it to rethink it from the exterior. I sat with her and explained her my view, told her to rethink things. We are now very happy and she is coming to terms with the fact that she needs emotional connection and not just hollow sex. She is one of the survivors of Hookup Culture, but someone had to talk to her in a different way and support her healing from that type of behavior. I'm very happy for her.

&amp;#x200B;

I really believe we must start discussing what is leading to Hookup Culture rather that discussing the consequences. On his book \*The Art of Thinking Clearly\*, Rolf Dobelli talks about a fallacy called ""Social proof"". We go on with our lives according to what society expects of us and thinks is normal or not. All this people that have daddy or mommy issues and real fear of attachment and intimacy are living this way, sinking slowly, because society and media tells them everyday that their behavior is normal and that they are liberated. This do not help a bit our more and more depressed society, what Bauman calls ""Liquid Modernity"". 

&amp;#x200B;

We have to stop accepting Hookup Culture, in order for people to heal and search for meaning in their lives. What i think is that we should do it not focusing on the consequences of casual sex but rather on the causes. By pointing people their issues, we are helping them to seek a better life for themselves. And we have to really do that, as a society!",2020-05-24 13:38:56,changemyview

CMV: Men have lower sexual value than women,"I know some people are not going to want to wade through a wall of text so I will try to do a short short version followed by my full point, though I think the fuller text is more interesting:  


Men's bodies, looks etc. don't count for much, in and of themselves next to women's. One observation is that women choose or are forced to use their looks and sexuality (sexual capital) to obtain something desired or avoid something unwanted whereas men do not. But generally speaking men Could not, their sexuality isn't prized enough for it to be useful coinage.

If you are a straight man and not exceedingly good looking, rich, famous or in the 99th percentile of confidence and comfort in yourself, you've probably noticed that women don't just hit on you constantly, you don't get approached all the time in public nor in bars. Hell, even if you do do the approaching its a struggle uphill, and there is a waterfall and no footholds or handholds and even if you make it to the top, there is a giant whose sole purpose is to kick you back into the ravine.  


People will object that women also do not get approached all the time. But we know this cannot be true of a lot of women. Personal anecdotes and experiences of mine aside, there are an endless stream of articles complaining specifically about women being approached all the time, at the wrong time, in the wrong place or even in the right place but the woman doesn't feel like being approached.  


And now for the long winded bit:

  

I think a lot of quarrels about the genders with the goal of egalitarianism in the background can be more reasonably approached by admitting that generally speaking, men and women are appraised differently, sexually. When I say sexually I mean romantically, particularly with respect to how much their perceived bodily and facial attractiveness merits, how much their sexual/romantic company is worth and what people are 'willing to exchange, give up or put up with' in order to pass selection tests, meet standards, be in with a shot, win someone over etc etc. 

Part of the reason I hold this view is because I think there is a lot of evidence for it, there is virtually no evidence against it (unless you engage in rhetorical or deliberative summersaults), Because I once fiercely believed the opposite (despite what reality, my ears and eyes should have told me) and last but not least because in almost all cases where people have tried to oppose it, the implicit assumptions in their discourse actually betrayed that they believe it too. 

A simple example in 'traditional dates' (which still exist today to some extent) Man meets woman for a date. Man pays. If their company is of equal value, what is he paying more for? 

An objection might be that women traditionally had lower paying jobs or had less money, but then we should expect a variance with women contributing more the more they earn, with the relationship completely inverted where the woman earns let's say, twice as much as the man. Another objection would be that the man is expressing his power via his financial largesse and although power of magnanimity can be a thing, it seems circular since the 'power' would be to obtain the woman's company, to maker her feel taken care of (in the hopes of romance/sex ). Since men are generally (not in sex or romance, which I want to problematise) considered to have more power, it would lead to the conclusion that women vying for men sexually or romantically is an even bigger power move on their part, but nobody ever asserts that to be the case. 

Let's move to online. On one big dating site, women respond to men 4% of the time while men respond to women 18% of the time^(1) . OkCupid also showed that the curve of men who estimated women's looks matches those women's looks whereas women perceived 80% of the men on the site as 'below average', a reasonable evaluation if men's looks and body are not prized as highly by women as women's looks and body are by men. 

Let's shift gears a look at a feminist lesbian woman who impersonated a man for 18 months and her counter-intuitive (to her) findings: ' 

'If you have never been sexually attracted to women, you will never quite understand the monumental power of female sexuality, except by proxy or in theory, nor will you quite know the immense advantage it gives us over men. Dating women as a man was a lesson in female power, and it made me, of all things, into a momentary misogynist, which I suppose was the best indicator that my experiment had worked. I saw my own sex from the other side, and I disliked women irrationally for a while because of it. I disliked their superiority, their accusatory smiles, their entitlement to choose or dash me with a fingertip, an execution so lazy, so effortless, it made the defeats and even the successes unbearably humiliating. Typical male power feels by comparison like a blunt instrument, its salvos and field strategies laughably remedial next to the damage a woman can do with a single cutting word: no.'2

The Psychologist Roy Baumeister (and others) has put forward the idea that sex functions like a female resource and that market-like effects obtain in hetero relationships. Cultural systems endow female sex with value but regard male sex as worthless (sausage party for e.g.). Put another way, male sexuality cannot usually be 'exchanged' for things in return.^(3) Remember the classic Friends episode where Chandler, echoing Monika, offers to do 'anything she wants in the bedroom' and she rolls her eyes at his debased coinage? Some will object that men are less proficient at giving women orgasms but this is not a serious objection since men are willing to offer and exchange all sorts of tokens for non-orgasmic erotic interactions. Social exchange theory illuminates how the person with lesser interest/investment has more power since the other person needs something they have. 

Evolutionary Psychologists have observed that other animals mate non-randomly and studies show humans prize different things and those things, differently. These patterns are discernible both in the animal kingdom and in humans' cross culturally and across historical time and also across different levels of development, wealth and egalitarian culture: 

'Feingold[\[52\]](https://evolution-institute.org/on-common-criticisms-of-evolutionary-psychology/#_edn52) meta-analytically examined what women ask for and what men advertise in public, real-world personal advertisements and found, as expected, women more than men ask for cues to willingness and ability to provide resources (e.g., 27% of women ask for high socioeconomic status compared to 7% of men). Men who advertise such status-related cues actually receive more responses from women, as well. For example, in a study that experimentally manipulated real-life personal ads, ads placed by men noting they were financially successful elicited the most interest, whereas for women physical attractiveness was the key[\[53\]](https://evolution-institute.org/on-common-criticisms-of-evolutionary-psychology/#_edn53). In a study of Polish personal ads, the top four cues displayed by men that received responses from women were good education, older age, high resource levels, and tall height[\[54\]](https://evolution-institute.org/on-common-criticisms-of-evolutionary-psychology/#_edn54). In a study of mail order brides from Colombia, Russia, and the Philippines, women universally listed ambition, status, and wealth as among their most desired attributes in a future husband[\[55\]](https://evolution-institute.org/on-common-criticisms-of-evolutionary-psychology/#_edn55). ' 

I would like to address some potential objections ahead of time:  


(A) But men focus on looks, youth, beauty  


(My Response): It's not true that men focus only on those things but it is true that men foreground them and see them as less negotiable than other things and instantly respond to them. Rather than overturning my point, this might be a partial explanation for my point. It would generate more questions e.g. why are men so focused on these things? 

(B) Men focus on women's beauty as a stratagem of power, it's not a compliment, men are lucky not to be valued for their looks, body etc  


(My Response) From their current point of view it doesn't feel that way to men. Although it's certainly cruel that women who don't meet beauty standards are less desirable than other women, they'd have to slide down incredibly far to be as undesirable as most men. Even so, it is more of a contextual point, my argument is that men are not valued as much for their looks and body, the argument still holds up even if you make a consequential claim that the resulting benefit is not desirable. Even at that, it's not the case that men who have say a good personality, or a good sense of humour etc but lack many other qualities have an army of women beating down their door.  


(C) But women do desire men's bodies/looks as much, Patriarchal culture stops them from expressing it.

(My Response) This could be true but it's impossible to know and there is a ton of evidence to the other side. We are all influenced by culture, the comparison wouldn't be what are women like, compared to men with no culture/social pressure it would be what are men and women like both of them without social/cultural pressure. Probably different to some extent, but the male emphasis, drive to obtaining sex holds up across culture, across time and in virtually any circumstance you can think of. So there are really two ideas (1) female sexuality is suppressed in it's expression (which I agree with and cannot be denied) and (2) Patriarchal values suppress female sexuality. (2) Has some truth to it but the problem is that male sexuality is also suppressed. It's not usually recognised to be so but you can tell from the angry, outraged and grossed-out reactions to men being openly sexual that it's not a simple binary. For example in the clergy, priests violate their vows more than nuns do even though both have sworn life-changing vows that are a matter higher than life or death in their belief system. Also consider gay men, the most promiscuous gay men are thousands of times more promiscuous than promiscuous gay women. You could make an argument that gay women are sexually repressed by patriarchal culture but this doesn't make a whole lot of sense, patriarchal culture doesn't tell women how to be attracted to other women, how to have sex with other women and it doesn't tell gay men either.

"CMV: Pitbulls are dangerous. They kill/injure more people than any other dog breed. Poor owners may make them worse, they are predisposed to violence in a way few(if any) other dog breeds are. In addition, their size makes them dangerous in a way that smaller breeds are not.","Hello all, I know Reddit loves pitbulls so I know this post might not be very popular. Any time I see a pitbull post on Reddit the comments are guaranteed to be filled with both pro and anti pitbull sentiments, but it's clear which side has more supporters based on the votes (and the fact that the post was popular in the first place). Personally I've always thought pitbulls were cute, and my friend had a pitbull growing up who only ever bit me once and it wasn't that bad, no worse than other dogs I had who would nip when they got excited. I personally have never experienced the level of violence from any dog that I've heard about in the news.

I want to like putbulls. They are a good size, they're sturdy dogs who are happy to go outside and explore the world. They've got lots and energy, big wide smiles and love to play. Who wouldn't enjoy that? However, looking at the statistics and information available to me, it just doesn't seem reasonable to come to the conclusion that pitbulls are a misunderstood breed that carry the same amount of risks that any other similarly sized dog might carry. 

Reasons why I hold this belief:

1.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_fatal\_dog\_attacks\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States) 
2. Insurance companies penalizing/refusing to cover pitbulls. These are companies that make their money off of risk management. If pitbulls weren't risks/didn't generate proportionally more insurance claims, they wouldn't raise premiums. There's a reason young adult males with sports cars have insane insurance premiums; they're simply a group at higher risk for insurance claims. These companies are not sexist against men, nor do they specifically hate pitbulls. Their business runs on risk management. 
3. The genetic history of  a dog can clearly have large sweeping effects on a dogs behavior. Why is ""every golden retriever"" always happy? Why does every pointer just know to point at birds in bushes? Why do border collies know how to herd sheep as soon as they're able to walk?  Why are chihuahuas so uptight? A dog with a breed history of unrestrained fighting and overwhelming evidence of killing/attacking people is really a smoking gun to me. 

Points that I have already addressed internally:

1. Violent pitbulls are the result of bad owners.
   1. Clearly. We agree on this point. My point is that the dog is predisposed to violence even when trained properly. There are simply too many stories of non-violent pitbulls suddenly snapping and killing a small child. If you'd like examples, feel free to read the list of fatal dog attacks. The majority of small children on that list are killed by pitbulls.
   2. Pitbulls don't only attack their owners. If being a bad pitbull owner meant you got attacked by your dog, fine. You brought it on yourself. But bad owners let their dogs out, they leave them alone with kids, and they bring the dog into public places where the dog does not have the tools to cope with the situation. Bad pitbull owners can accidentally kill or maim other people, and that is just awful. 
2. The majority of pitbulls will never hurt anyone.
   1. Probably. I am attempting to relate the danger of pitbulls to other breeds of dog, not to some absolute measure of danger. 
3. ""Many different breeds are called pitbulls whenever there is a violent attack, pitbulls are not really responsible"".
   1. The ratio of ""pitbull"" attacks to other dogs is simply too high. According to this study [https://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/2016/02/17/dna-studies-reveal-that-shelter-workers-often-mislabel-dogs-as-pit-bulls/](https://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/2016/02/17/dna-studies-reveal-that-shelter-workers-often-mislabel-dogs-as-pit-bulls/) by the University of Florida, pitbulls were correctly identified only 33% to 70% of the time. Even if you reduced the number of violent pitbull attacks by 1/3 (to account for the mislabeling), they would still vastly outnumber other breeds.
4. ""Chihuahas (or any other breed) are actually more prone to violence"". Those breeds may be more violent, but they clearly do not kill or injure in the numbers that pibulls do. I'm sorry if you have a violent chihuahua(or any other breed), that sounds terrible. At least it doesn't weigh 80 lbs!
5. Anecdotal evidence.
   1. Obviously, right? The only personal experience I have of pitbulls is positive, but I can't deny what I see on the internet, in published literature, and on the news. 

&amp;#x200B;

Common anti-pitbull sentiments that I do not agree with:

1. Pitbulls should be outlawed.
   1. No. People who own pitbulls should absolutely not have them taken away. Breed specific legislation is rarely useful or effective anyways.
2. All/most pitbulls should be euthanized.
   1. No. Pitbulls are living creatures. Their lives are less valuable than a persons life, but they are not forfeit. The animals should be treated fairly and humanely, and only euthanized if a situation where any other dog would meet the same fate. 
3. &amp;#x200B;

 I know on this subreddit what often happens when someone's ""view is changed"" is that a commenter is able to find a very specific wording in the original post and refute it by proposing a specific scenario where the original statement may not apply, even if the broad point was not really addressed. The OP is then forced to said ""yeah I guess in that scenario you're right"", and thus they give out a delta. I'm hoping to have my view addressed more directly, and am happy to engage with commenters.

CMV: I'm supposed to own a military grade weapon,"Ok so when the 2nd Amendment was framed the standard military rifle was a single shot muzzle loading musket and the hunting rifles that the colonists had were single shot muzzle loading muskets that of which makes it that the colonists had a military grade weapon of the time

Now we all know that time has changed and we have  new guns on the market and new military grade weaponry, shouldn't I be allowed to own the same gun any military currently carries because as the well regulated militia it's our job to be able to defend ourselves against tyranny since corruption and military takeover is always a possibility 

Now the reason for the 2nd Amendment is because of a tyrant that wanted to disarm the colonists and because the founding fathers didn't even want a standing military, we were to be the military when the country needed us to be to protect our freedoms and liberties, which is why it Is written ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to bear arms, shall not be infringed"" this is the very thing that protects the rest of the Constitution and should remain in such a manner

CMV: I don’t understand why cheating on your partner completely changes your feelings toward them.,"Look I’m not saying that you should fool around with other people, it’s still a shitty thing to do. But people get cheated on and act like everything has changed, that the person they knew or was married to for potentially years doesn’t exist anymore, as if the whole relationship is a lie. They act like the earth was shattered around them. I understand there’s broken trust/betrayal and you should talk to them about how you feel and what happened and they should be sorry and regretful. I don’t get how u can look at your feelings toward a person you loved and claim you truly loved them, then have those feelings disappear because someone regretfully broke your trust. People say cheating is “zero tolerance” and that if anyone cheats you then you should leave immediately. I don’t think you could love someone truly and deeply and end those feelings for a decision they regret and apologize for. Obviously if there’s a pattern of cheating or they don’t feel bad or regret it then you shouldn’t be together anyway. But letting regretted mistakes ruin an otherwise deep relationship just makes me think you can’t forgive others weakness.
I’d like to reiterate, if you cheated and don’t regret what you did to your partner then your almost definitely an Ahole",2020-05-24 03:56:56,changemyview

Adopting a child doesnt have to be a charitable thing you do out of pity and many people only see adoption as a cause or a good deed, and even though it is a good deed, that shouldnt be the only thing it is, it should be seen as raising a member into society as if they were your own blood. foster kids shouldnt be seen as charitable, theyre human beings, not fundraisers.",2020-05-24 03:32:00,changemyview
CMV: There is nothing wrong with Otherkin,"Oh boy, here we go. Otherkin are people who identify on a *non-physical* level as a non-human entity. It's easy to believe that we are delusional, I'll admit, but the people you see on the internet are not the majority of the community.

CMV: Lebron James is not one of the top 10 NBA/ABA players of all time,"**How I define top players is ""how much value does this player add to an average team playing in all eras?""**

**I answer this question based on 4 factors:**

1. Statistics
2. Championships
3. Understanding - this means understanding 1 and 2 based on relevant factors, such as: position played, quality of teammates, era played in, strength of overall league, strength of top opposing teams, and physicality of play allowed by referees
4. Soft factors such as leadership, defense, willpower, unselfish play, basketball IQ
5. Innovations of how the game is played

**I must confess that I think that players who play today or have played in the past decade or two are usually a bit over-rated as compared to players who played in the 1990s and before the 1990s.  Because:**

1. Media hype of players playing today for purposes of driving profits, ratings, revenues, $
2. Lack of knowledge about the greats of earlier eras among many fans
3. The ""no contact sport"" basketball has become; it was rough in 1990s and before - today it is not nearly as rough as it has been in the past, with referees calling fouls for much less contact
4. The fewer teams in the early eras meant talent was MUCH more concentrated on a per-team basis
5. For a variety of reasons, players today go around to teams in order to win championships and to get good stats, while in the old days there was for several reasons a lot more loyalty to a team franchise so great players had to work with what they had to win a championship (and not just leave to join another team with other great players if they doubted their chances of winning)

**My top 14 (roughly in order from best to worst in my opinion):**

1. Michael Jordan (SG)
2. Wilt Chamberlain (C)
3. Kareem Abdul Jabbar (C)
4. Magic Johnson (PG)
5. Oscar Robertson (PG)
6. Bill Russell (C)
7. Hakeem Olajuwon (C)
8. Larry Bird (SF)
9. Kobe Bryant (SG)
10. Elgin Baylor (SF)
11. Julius Erving (SF)
12. Tim Duncan (PF)
13. Jerry West (SG)
14. Shaquille O'Neal (C)

"CMV: ""Welfare programs"" and ""Stripping your freedom"" isn't interchangeable","I genuinely don't understand why people have such a hard time understanding the difference between the two. Welfare is defined as ""statutory procedure or social effort designed to promote the basic physical and material well-being of people in need"". Freedom is defined as ""the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint."" These are the definitions I will be using in my argument.

Let's say, god forbid, the US brings over some welfare programs like fifteen dollar minimum wage, free tuition for college, and universal healthcare. So having all these programs would require increased taxes. Now, let's run through our list of freedoms to see which one has destroyed. Higher tax rates wouldn't exactly stop me from thinking whatever I want. I can still say whatever I want. The power to act may seem like a contentious point, but none of what I just said stops me from doing anything. I can still go to university (now for free!), get a decent paying job, start a business, or maybe I just want to be homeless, which is ok because none of those programs stop me from doing that.

When people say strip your freedoms, what they really mean is two things, having to pay increased taxes, and being uncomfortable having the rich pay much higher taxes. For the first point, if you only think in terms of paying the taxes, then yeah it sounds bad having to pay even more. But this doesn't account for the fact that what you lose in taxes, you gain back towards the ability to have atleast a living wage in any job you get, severely reduced expense for college that would have otherwise cost you tens of thousands, no co-pay every time you have to see the doctor, and guarantee that you won't be fronted with an enormous bill if some emergency happens and results in you having to pay a debt for many years. 

As for increasing taxes on the rich, whatever happened to the saying ""With great power comes great responsibility""? Even if you don't believe that corporations owes society anything, it's simply not true. Who buys out large amounts of real estate, causes a large percentage of pollution, deforestation, outsourcing of labor, rakes in subsidies and bailouts, often gets away with paying little to no federal taxes, gets given government contracts etc. Only rich and powerful corporations can attain all of these benefits that no middle class individual could really cause or gain. We as a society give more than just our money for their products, we give them all the stuff I listed before, and yet every time they do something stupid and mismanage savings, we give our tax payer money to them simply because they hold too many jobs and a GDP percentage. 

And if you're worried that increasing taxes will cause these corporations and rich elites to leave, I want you to consider this. The most expensive colleges in the US in terms of tuition include Dartmouth, Upenn, University of Chicago, Duke, Brown etc. Despite being so expensive, why do so many people contest for a spot in one of these schools? Because cost isn't the only thing people look at when they choose a college. The reputation, the opportunities afforded, the ability to work with like minded people, and the resources offered are all viable factors as well. Do you really think Apple and Amazon are just going to flee if we finally start taxing them properly? That they would just give up a 325 million strong market, direct competition with other big corporations, resources to research and expand, the ability to work with the United States government, and be placed in the largest economy in the world?",2020-05-24 02:04:52,changemyview
CMV: Corporate lobbying offers little to no benefits to a democracy that redeem the many negative effects it has on the average taxpayer. It is also the most glaring flaw in American politics.,"As a whole, when corporations lobby politicians it negatively affects a country's population.  If a business or individual has enough liquid funds to significantly sway the implementation of policies and laws, they will likely use that power to create an environment to benefit themselves the most.  There are of course exceptions to that statement such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Andrew Carnegie but on average that statement rings true.  

Additionally, when a handful large companies control the vast majority of media outlets in a country such as the United States it further increases the sway businesses have over voters and when paired with lobbying, creates an environment where monopolies or oligopolies are protected.  This is the greatest threat to democracy in the world and the main reason why it was so difficult for a candidate like Bernie Sanders to garnish as much support as he did.  As a slight aside, Bernie fought for every low and middle income person in America which terrified those who held the most money, thus the most power.  His choice to not accept funds from super PACs was a foundational ideal of his platform.

To achieve true democracy, lobbying should either be limited dramatically or banned outright.  Another helpful tool for voters would be strict and publicly available lobbyist registries.  This would help voters track which corporations are backing which politicians and help them to decide how to vote.  Granted there would still be voters who would vote for their party no matter how really available this information is, which is why banning or regulating it heavy would be the best option.

I can be a fairly stubborn person, but I'm interested to see what you guys think.  Is there a more dramatic threat to democracy we should be focusing on or any unforseen benefits corporate lobbying creates that may outweigh the damage it does?

CMV: Poor people shouldn’t have kids,"This is obviously incredibly controversial, but hear me out. I live in South Africa which is one of the most unequal countries in the world, I grew up middle class and started working in unprivileged communities and was blown away by how ill equipped their parents were to parent them and how despite being ravished by poverty by poverty they continued to have more kids. 

I’ve done a bit of research on this and it turn out that poverty affects brain development, children’s health and academic success. Poor children are more likely to witness violence and experience it than their wealthier counterparts. Poor parents are generally uneducated and less likely to support their children’s educational development or give them access to better educational opportunities. Poor parents are under more stress and are generally harsher, inconsistent parents and emotionally distant. And poverty is generally transmitted from generation to generation. 

I worked in two schools one in an underprivileged area, the other in an affluent area. The kids in the underprivileged area were 12, the kids in the affluent area were 6, and when I tell you that the 6 years olds were able to handle conflict amongst themselves adequately with very little adult involvement, they were able to regulate their emotions.years old. The 12 years old always handled conflict through violence, they were unable to regulate their emotions. The difference was stark. 

My mother came from a poor family and she broke the cycle of poverty, so I’m aware there are exceptions to the rule, but I’m also so aware that poverty can lead so many traumatized children, feeling they aren’t in control of their lives, thereby perpetuating the cycle they find themselves in and further entrenching themselves in poverty. So poor people should have kids.",2020-05-23 22:36:35,changemyview
CMV: Human are extremely inefficient at progressing scientifically/technologically,"It seems we are biologically predisposed to spend more time on dramatic events, celeb news, religious beliefs, entertainment rather than acquiring knowledge. Most people don't even care about the scientific method and believe what they want to believe, which is usually something that makes them feel nice and warm.

Religion has clearly stalled scientific progress, and our current societal structure also doesn't allow for rapid progress. Most engineers/scientists out of college join jobs that focus on incremental improvements in popular technology like improving Facebook's UI a little bit or making Google's news feed 0.1% better. While this is seemingly important, it isn't as impactful as one would hope. Now one naturally may turn to scientific researchers and hope they are the ones moving the needle. But they too fall prey to internal politics, have pressure to publish lower quality papers to survive (""publish or perish"") and even after they get tenure, who knows how ambitious they are? It is also important to note that there are only 7.8 million researchers in the world in all fields combined, which is 0.1% of the world's population. This means 99.9% of the world's population does not actively try to discover new things and make them known.

People have families, and several other needs (like entertainment, socialization, etc). This makes humans extremely inefficient at making progress.

"CMV: If you are not living in a swing state, voting third party is not a ""wasted vote."" (USA politics)","I live in California, a state that in November, will give all 55 of her electoral votes to Joe Biden. There's nothing within reason anyone can do to change that fact, unless he dies, which then it will go to whoever his Democratic replacement is. I hate Donald Trump and I hate Joe Biden, I do think that Biden would be less bad than Trump, but whether I vote for Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Jacob Hornberger, Howie Hawkins, or Jesus Christ himself, California's electoral votes will go to Joe, so why should I give my vote to someone I don't like. But even when I bring this point up, people still tell me I'm ""wasting my vote"" if I consider voting for a third party, and I'm ""contributing to Trump's re-election."" 

But in a non-swing state, voting third party could be making more of an impact than voting for one of the major parties. If a third party candidate reaches 5% of the national vote, they will get federal funding which could really help a party gain some more influence. And it doesn't seem out of the total realm of possibility, Gary Johnson got like 3% of the vote in 2016. I don't expect this to cause, say the Green Party to become just as big as the main two or anything, but they might be able to gain some kind of influence with that kind of money.

cmv:Islam should not be accepted.,"I have always viewed religion as a tool created by the people to reassure and calm them with the pains and questions of existence. I have seen how it unifies people how it gives meaning to their lifes and how it teaches morals and humanity, and for that i tolerate and accept it as i find it beneficial to society when used for the above unlike many these days who choose to demonize it. That being said there's one who's principles i don't respect, Islam. It's by far the most hateful barbaric and extreme that all the others, it doesn't acknowledge basic human rights, it even embraces holy war, HOLY WAR. 

I have always found weird how usually the most decisive factor to one's religion is simply where he has born, something not chosen by the individual but by mere luck and thus have no hate in my heart for Muslims, i view them as victims more or less to oppression by their own faith which as i mentioned before should actually serve the people and liberate them rather than view them as the tools to enable it to oppress others. Maybe i'm being too harsh or ignorant but i see it as more harmful than beneficial to any society and therefore reject it.

Today there have been atrocities by both those defending and attacking it, atrocities that could have been avoided. Hate at the very end breeds more hate. Yet that doesn't mean islam should not be criticized neither that anyone criticizing it is automatically racist and islamophobic.

Before we start, let me say what definition of racism I'm using. Google's definition. This is also the general notion of racism in which many people believe.

Some POC seem to think they can't be racist to White People due to the system of power. ""The oppressed can't oppress the oppressor."" is something a lot of those who believe this bring up. I think that quote is simply idiotic. The quote is true, just the way they use it is wrong. I'll elaborate.

Who's the oppressor exactly? A system can favor a race, but who runs the system? People do. People can be racist, the system cannot inherently be racist. Systemic racism is a result from people in power. Those specific racist people in power are the oppressors from that quote above. This all is correct, but what comes next is where the logic is twisted. 

Their argument is that due to the systematic racism causing them to be oppressed, white privilege, and that quote from above, that they cannot be racist toward white people. All of which reference and come from the specific racist white individuals in power, and yet those people are being used to justify racism against white people not being a thing.

CMV: Bicyclists should not be allowed to bike on roads with no reasonable bike lane.,"I’m an American living in a ‘rural’ area of the tri-state area, which means that although the large, sprawling properties and thick woods give the illusion of a low population, in reality, there’s a lot of non-local foot (or wheel) traffic going through the area. The closest sidewalked area to me is half an hour away, and there’s one (1) street lamp in my entire town, and it’s outside the elementary school. There’s not a single bike lane anywhere and the majority of roads don’t even have a white line on the side of the road. Few roads are straight or flat enough to make it easy to pass bikers/dog walkers, and I have seen cars scrape each other when passing bikers (tbf they should have waited for a better opportunity to pass the biker, but in both cases were teenagers, so like...). 

Our area is located in the middle of several wildlife refuges and national parks. This means there are an over abundance of well-maintained trails, several of which are actually paved. However, I only ever see bikers on tiny roads, toodling along at 10-15 mph. These aren’t normal bikers either- I don’t mind it (although I think it is exceptionally ill-advised) when I see ‘regular’ people biking, because chances are they’re from around here and they’re actually *going somewhere*. 

I wouldn’t mind the CrossFit cross country walking Coca Cola advertisements or whatever they are (as much) if all they did was obstruct traffic and pose a significant danger to themselves and to others. After all, if you can’t pass them around a corner, you do, unfortunately, just have to wait. 

However, they are the least considerate human beings on the planet. There are at least a dozen signs in my area posted by the police begging them to drive single file when a car is trying to pass them. I have been flipped off twice when passing them because I got ‘too close’ to them when they were biking three in a row, with the leftmost one basically toeing the yellow line. Sure, some of them will switch to single file, but they are the outliers. In fact, many of the single riders will situate themselves smack in the center of the road rather than off to the side, and won’t budge when a car approaches from behind. 

Other frequently observed crimes against humanity include: 
* the 10+ times I have seen bikers happily roll on by when there are turtles crossing the road and other wildlife hazards common to the area that typically require human intervention 
* the two occasions I’ve seen bikers literally run over dying birds instead of even trying to stop and help 
* the many, MANY times I’ve caught them smoking at the foot of my driveway. For a bunch of health nuts they sure don’t seem to care about their lungs
* the roughly dozen or so signs I’ve had to pull out of my front yard saying things like ‘stay hydrated! Sponsored by Pepsi’ (they stopped after my dad started peppering the signs with shotgun pellets- but they’ve simply moved them to other people’s yards)
* their blatant disregard for the rules of the road, including blasting through four way stops without even looking, running red lights, and refusing to use arm signals when turning
* the fact that when they ride together, they have to scream their conversations at each other at 8 in the morning in a quiet residential area. I’ve seen at least ten different signs in people’s yards begging them to stay quiet in the morning
* the one notable occasion where they tried to set up a ‘checkpoint’ or something for some race I guess in a neighbor’s yard. They called the cops when the neighbor tried to make them leave (tbf I know this neighbor- he’s 6’6 and about 300 lbs and quite intimidating) but the cops told them to gtfo because it was private property. They limped across the street to national park territory and began blasting loud music for the rest of the day and selling water bottles
* the other notable occasion where they WOULD NOT get off the road (when there was an actual side of the road to move to- there generally isn’t in my area, it’s just a watery ditch or thickets of bramble) to get out of the way for a FUNERAL PROCESSION, despite being honked at. They cut off half of the procession, who ended up making it to the burial about 10 minutes late because of them

BEFORE ANYONE SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT CITIES: I do not live in a city. Bikers in cities, from my experience, tend to be regular folk just trying to get around. Even the exercise nuts will obey traffic rules BECAUSE there are cameras everywhere, pedestrian hazards, and most importantly, BIKE LANES. I think it’s a tragedy that cars and others don’t respect properly marked bike lanes- they’re not a place to park or haul your trash on trash day. And I wouldn’t mind one bit if I had to pass a biker who was passing an obstruction in a bike lane. 

But out here, where a biker literally cannot get off the road in an emergency because there’s a 4 ft deep storm drain ditch 0.2 inches from the side of the road, where roads are barely wide enough for two cars going in opposite directions to pass each other, where people value their peace and quiet, and where it is objectively dangerous to be anything other than a car on the road, I do not think bikers should be allowed. These roads are not your gym. There are plenty of well-established biking trails in our area that are very rarely visited by bikers. If you’re going to be on the road, you need to obey all reasonable traffic rules and you CANNOT make a left turn from a red light while someone in a car with a green light is also making a left turn, and then turn and curse out the person who was obeying the rules while you were breaking them. The rule is *share* the road, not monopolize it. This isn’t your suburbia and it’s certainly not your city. These are dangerous, badly maintained roads that weren’t even designed for pedestrians, let alone bikers. 

I would like to change my mind about them because due to current events, there are more of them than ever, and it’s emotionally tolling to fly into a rage every half a mile when I see another biker doing something stupid on my morning commute.",2020-05-23 17:27:45,changemyview

In comparison, AskMen has a much more hands off approach towards discussions. They have their own rules and those rules are enforced, but the enforcing of those rules don't diminish the overall quality of the sub.

And the numbers show for it. Despite being created at almost the same time, a month apart, AskWomen has half the subscribers that AskMen does. In addition, by looking at the top posts in both subs over the past year, AskWomen's posts have maybe about 20% of the upvotes and comments that AskMen has.

I can only attribute this to AskWomen's moderation making it an undesirable and unattractive place for people to be on, but I think it would be way more popular if the mods let loose on the rules a little.",2020-05-23 17:16:40,changemyview

CMV: Finishing other people's sentences is not romantic,"There is nothing romantic about finishing sentences. I find it crazy that it is viewed as synonymous with being in love. It is as rude as it is annoying. Interrupting someone mid sentence is narcissistic and gives off the impression that the listener believes themselves to be so smart that they know what's to be said before it is said. Or that the speaker is so predictable that they're not worth the two-seconds required to finish listening. I don't know if this differentiates by cultural standards. My mother is German and her side of the family sits round a coffee table and talks over each other for hours. In Canada we can get rowdy at times but if someone is speaking we let them talk. The only time I could see finishing someone’s sentence as romantic is if they had a disability and required help in social settings. Other than that it is disrespectful, I believe.",2020-05-23 16:30:21,changemyview
CMV: Political Subs with questionable or No moderators should be shut down,"Politics are a very volatile subject already, so when you throw bias and emotion into the mix the facts or message gets clouded real quick.

Based solely on the subs name you would think to find memes about Biden or Trump. Not really anything about Trump, but a whole lot of anti Biden and Bernie love. 

If you mention the obvious you’re met with a wave of downvotes and edgy 14 year olds explaining how hot Biden memes are instead of the facts.

CMV: The death sentence has no place in a civilized society,"By civilized society, I'm talking about a society that puts emphasis on due process, justice, human rights and freedom. I have some arguments that show why:

1. From an ideological standpoint, I believe the government should not have the power to take away a person's very existence. A government's job is to serve the people by means of ensuring peace and stability. This includes the power to take away dangerous persons from society and confine them to a cell (sometimes for life), to promote peace and stability. The death sentence extends this power beyond its original scope, because the government judges whether a person is entitled to its existence. This is beyond reasonable and can only lead to abuse, which history has plenty of examples of.

2. It's not effective in deterring crime. Multiple studies have shown that the probability of getting caught is an important factor in deterring crime, the severity of the punishment isn't. When a criminal is doing his crime, he's thinking about when the cops will be there. He's not thinking about what his punishment can be, simple as that.

3. It's extremely cruel. It's not equal to murdering someone. It's equal to telling someone the exact date they're going to die and locking them into a cage for the meantime. That's sure to lead to mental disorders and unusually cruel.

4. The existence of false convictions, which I don't have to explain further.

These are the common counterarguments I hear:

1. **It's cheaper to kill criminals than to put them in a cage for life.** It actually isn't because an average death row procedure can take up to 20 years with a shitload of time and legal costs. One can argue that means we should cut down the appeal process to reduce the time and costs, but that's taking away a lot of safeguards a convict has and ultimately sacrificing due process. Killing someone is the ultimate form of punishment, which requires the most extensive amount of appeal options.

2. **Some people can't be fixed.** While I agree with that, there's no reason why a life sentence wouldn't suffice in lieu of a death sentence if that's the case. If a person will always remain a danger to society, they should be taken away from it forever. The people arguing this usually aren't satisfied with that, which brings me to my next point.

3. **They deserve it.** Most of the proponents of the death sentence ultimately care more about fueling their emotional feelings of vengeance, than actual justice. They will say ""So you don't think a child-rapist deserves to die??"" which demonstrates their feelings of anger. I believe however, in a civilized society, people are judged based on logic and facts, not on emotional responses. Otherwise we're really no better than the people we so eagerly want to kill. Maybe they do deserve it, maybe not. Even the wisest of philosophers couldn't give you a definite answer to that. It's ultimately subjective and beside the point of criminal law. A government's job isn't to decide whether people deserve to die, it's to keep the peace.",2020-05-23 15:32:18,changemyview
"CMV - In a developed country, those who remain poor do so by choice.","First I should probably establish that by developed country, I mean countries where people feasibly have the means to escape poverty available in the first place. The US, UK and most of Europe would qualify here, most of the middle East and Africa would obviously not.

And by ""by choice"" I obviously don't mean people literally choose to be poor. I mean that they squander opportunities that are available to them, and make bad choices that perpetuate their circumstances. Essentially, the combined act of not making good choices and actively making bad ones are what I consider to qualify as ""choosing to remain poor"".

Whenever I say this, I'm met with usually one of four responses. None of which are convincing so I'll lay them out here to save us time. 

A. People have children and once that happens, it's difficult to escape poverty. 

Response: in almost all developed countries you have available contraception, adoption, abortion and abstinence. Other than an abortion in some cases, all developed countries have these options. I beleive the presence of at least 3 alternatives means that, if you have a child, you *chose* to have that child. 

B. Some poor people are addicted to drugs, that eats up huge chunks of income.

Response: I reject the disease model of addiction. Taking drugs (alcohol included) is always a conscious choice. We have free will, choosing to continue getting high, is choosing to remain poor. 

C. Unforeseen circumstances like the 08 crash can hit anyone at any time. 

Response: this is the only one I remotely consider valid, because I can't help but agree that it could happen at any time. But, you always have the ability to save for unforeseen circumstances, if you choose not to then that lack of preparedness is your downfall, and your choice.

However, this also the reason I choose the word *remain* in my title. I accept that even with proper preparedness, something disastrous might happen that costs you everything. I accept that you might be temporarily poor, but I see no valid reason why you would then remain that way until you die.

D. Debt and the money it costs to service that debt. 

Response: firstly, all debts were taken on by you, out of choice. Nobody forces you to take out loans or credit cards. Secondly, bankruptcy. I realise this isn't a ""get out of jail free card"" but it is an option that effectively resets the meter for you. If your pride is what prevents you from going bankrupt, that is your choice. 

So any of the above four arguments are incredibly unlikely to convince me, but I'm interested to see what else people consider to be a factor, that I may have overlooked.",2020-05-23 15:08:06,changemyview

CMV: Regardless of the future presidential election outcome Roe v. Wade will not be overturned,"*Roe v. Wade* is not going to be overturned. The right to get an abortion is not going anywhere in the United States. Over the past 2 weeks alone I have seen countless Facebook postings from my liberal/progressive friends that we must ensure Trump is not re-elected because he will appoint SCOTUS justices who will overturn Roe in some way. This sort of argument has been increasing on social media since Joe Biden was named the nominee, and it is a way for the center-left/liberal/progressives to try and argue that even if you did not like Joe Biden you must vote for him in the election because as one poster said “we are voting for Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s replacement”. I am a Democrat and I will be voting for Joe Biden, but even if I was not doing so I would not be afraid of Roe being overturned for the following reasons: 

1.) The SCOTUS yesterday, today and tomorrow is comprised of justices who know deep down that Roe v. Wade cannot be overturned and that in general the right to safe legal abortion cannot be overturned or surrendered to individual states. In June 1992 *Planned Parenthood of Southern Pennsylvania v. Casey* was argued. The decision was 5-4 in favor of Planned Parenthood and the majority opinion was comprised of both liberal and conservative justices. A liberal justice (Byron White) had jumped ship to side with the conservatives but the pro-choice side still won. This case was not a direct target of Roe but it was a good indicative test of how a possible redo of Roe would be decided. It should be noted that the only liberal justice who sided with the conservatives, Justice White, was the only liberal justice to vote against Roe when it was originally argued in the 1970s and had any other liberal justice been on the court in his seat they would have moved the marker for the Planned Parenthood case from 5-4 to 6-3 favoring Roe. 

2.) It is common in high profile SCOTUS cases that are 5-4 to have a justice jump ship and side with the side they usually do not. This is going to be in favor of preserving Roe as this tends to happen more often with conservative justices joining liberal justices. In the most recent years in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* chief justice John Roberts after hearing justice Anthony Kennedy would be voting with the other conservatives to rule the Affordable Care Act mandate as unconstitutional then decided to side with the 4 liberal justices and rule the ACA individual mandate as constitutional. Notice that Kennedy only did this to preserve the ACA, even though he himself did not originally intend to vote the way he did, he originally did not appear to believe the individual mandate was constitutional. This would be the outcome of a Roe case should one ever be brought in front of the SCOTUS most likely also. 

3) The SCOTUS is either aligned more with the present or future times and almost never rules in favor of undoing things similar to Roe. There are countless examples of this, *Roe v. Wade* being one of them. *Brown v. Board of Education* being another where the court decided something against the will of what was considered standard at the time by many people. There are only a very small number of cases in the past 40 to 50 years I can think of that show that the court is willing to reverse more progressive ideals, the main example I can think of would be the SCOTUS in *Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission*, which allowed a business owner to refuse making a wedding cake for a gay couple. I myself am a gay man and this case hurts me on an emotional level, but I along with most people who have studied the court knew this was going to be the outcome and most importantly, the SCOTUS was not overturning anything they had previously decided on but was instead re-affirming the free exercise clause (the only thing overturned was a state law). 

4) Going off number 3, the Reagan/Bush pro-life movement is no longer with us as it once was and the hopes of having a “pro-life” generation of voters has not panned out. Instead, at best, my generation of younger voters is either just as pro-life or slightly more pro-choice as the voters in the early 1980s through the 2000’s. The justices on the court in more recent years (and most likely in the future) appointed by Republican presidents (i.e. Neil Gorsuch) have become increasingly identified as traditional liberal (libertarian) justices who are not going to vote to overturn Roe as quickly as a truly conservative justice (i.e. Samuel Alito). 

5) The SCOTUS is not made up of ""liberal and conservative justices"" alone, it is made up of **people** who understand the horrible effects overturning Roe **would** **have**. The conservative justices would surely prepare to vote to overturn Roe in some way, ***up until they realize they are actually going to overturn Roe v. Wade*** and come to terms and realize the days of back alley abortions and women dying to get abortions would return in the United States. Also, in recent years the court has blocked over-reaching abortion bans as well by states. 

6) The idea that the court would overturn Roe and return the decision on abortions directly to the states is just as unlikely as a full-blown ban on abortions nationwide. I believe that the court knows, especially in recent years with them striking down so many state’s overreaching abortion bans, that the day will never come where we see what Donald Trump had said he would be approving of, which is letting individual states dictate their decisions on abortion.",2020-05-23 14:19:40,changemyview

"CMV: Without foreign military intervention, the Hong Kong protests will fail","Reposting/rewording bc zero people replied last time for some reason haha

The recent security laws set out by China targeting Hong Kong's unrest have earned the ire of protesters and the international community. Noble gestures against a tyrannical, bloodthirsty regime, but unless the West is willing to move past mere economic sanctions and surround Hong Kong with warships, they will be allowing China to enact another Tiananmen Square ""incident"". The Hong Kong crisis can only be solved through substantial military action.

The Communist Party of China will not accede to much more of the protesters' demands. Many mainlanders view the Hong Kong protesters as violent rioters and terrorists, and negotiating with them will be seen as the Party going back on its own nationalistic principles for a united China. Xi Jinping is no Gorbachev, and internal reform on this issue seems extremely unlikely. ""One country, two systems"" was already a massive concession for Beijing, let alone independence. 

Hong Kong lacks a standing army, substantial natural resources, or geographic distance from mainland China (one advantage Taiwan has) to give the PLA any second thoughts of occupation.

The protesters seem unlikely to give up either, due to the Party's stubbornness and the unanimously favorable coverage of them by Western media. Any imprisonments or forced disappearances will be widely publicized unless the Communist Party forces their way into the city and imposes a media blackout. Even if the protesters cease their violence, the PLA will likely institute a violent crackdown anyway.

It seems the only alternative for Hong Kong to retain democracy until 2047 is for more powerful military actors to get involved, e.g. the United States, which seems unlikely given the promises set out in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and Hong Kong's current lack of strategic value to other countries outside of diplomatic virtue-signaling. The protests were allowed to happen in order for the Communist Party to be able to portray the protesters as violent secessionists. 

In the end, there will be no peaceful solution to the Hong Kong problem. China or the West will inevitably have to send in troops to quell the issue. CMV.",2020-05-23 12:01:34,changemyview

CMV: You are NOT a pedophile if you are attracted to someone who is between the ages of 14-17.,"You are NOT a pedophile if you are attracted to someone who is between the ages of 14-17. 


I know there’s the hebephilia copypasta that basically says this and Dave Chappelle’s famous routine ‘how old is 15 really?’. I’m using my throwaway since I know I’ll be accused of being a pedo but I’ve seen the word ‘nonce’ and ‘pedo’ being thrown around a lot recently. Of course, it depends on how ‘developed’ the person is. Some 14 year olds LOOK like 14 year olds and others look considerably older but to admit you’re attracted doesn’t mean you’re a child molester. It’s crazier when it comes to the age 17. 

Most states would consider that legal, others (including around the world) don’t but if you were to date a 17 year old you would be labelled a pedophile? When I was 17 I had a stable job, prepared myself to travel and live in another city for uni. If I dated a woman who was 27 would she be a pedo? Let’s swap sexes. What about then? 

I just feel like there’s a huge secret men are hiding from themselves and project anger on others for feeling the same. The word jailbait exists for a reason. I will put my head on the line and admit I find Freya Allan (Ciri from The Witcher) attractive. She is 18 but she looks a bit younger (hence why she played Ciri) and a year ago she would’ve been considered a ‘child’ despite the contrary. I’ve seen the memes that graze upon this universal agreement that ‘yes we find her attractive but haha FBI open up or the opposite with if she’s 15 I’m 15.’ 

Porn trends are a clear reflection and acceptance that most men are attracted to girls who look younger, tinier breasts, skinnier body and a ‘jailbaity’ looking face. I hate the incest storylines which I’m sure Freud would’ve LOVED to analyse but it speaks to something else about society. We’re hypocrites. I’m not saying we should sexualise teenagers, that’s already happened. I’m not saying we should attempt to date and have sexual relations with 14 year old girls that may look a little older because that should be considered immoral and illegal. But to deny that you find them attractive and be labelled a child molester defeats the initial point. It’s not wrong to be attracted but it could be wrong to act on it. 

The physical appearance is closer to an adult than to a child but perhaps the immaturity isn’t. That should be the only degree of measurement when it comes to saying ‘she’s underage.’ 

The universal age of consent will always be a point of debate because of cultural differences. It seems the median is 16 yet a 40 year old man will still be unable to have sex with a 16 year old without a huge stigma and even possible legal ramifications. 18 is the only age (I’m 24) I would date at this point. I can’t relate at all to anyone younger (the TikTok generation?) because again I find them too immature. 

But again using TikTok as an example; I remember seeing a 16 year old girl (who looked much older: bigger breasts, makeup hid any ‘teenage’ signs and was taller than average) dancing provocatively on the app which was shared to Twitter and people used the word ‘pedo’ because they found out she was ‘underage’ despite their own initial attraction.

CMV: Feminist and Trans activist principles fundamentally contradict each other,"The main question is what makes a woman?

1. Feminists will say it's not dresses, or long hair, or pink, or any other socially construct. It's the biology of having certain lady parts and chromosomes. (Gender is biological)

2. Trans activists will say it's not biology, because a lady doesn't need breasts or specific genatalia or chromosomes. When someone ""transitions"", they usually don't get surgery or hormones. But they will start wearing dresses, growing long hair, long nails, etc. (Gender is expression)

When I see trans/feminists questioned on this at marches, a few will claim gender is just ""identity"" completely detached from any biology or expression. 

But I don't think they actually believe this. If I (biological man) claimed to be a woman without changing my body (gender isn't biological) or my dress/actions (gender isn't expression) or my sexual preferences (gender isn't sexual attraction) and tried to get elected to some position of power in a feminist/trans effort to get more minorities in positions of power, neither group would support me.

It's a sweet story about how someone helped out a delivery guy friend when he was in a bad financial situation and got repaid afterwards. However I couldn't cringe hard enough when she mentioned this guy was ranting online how he couldn't hold it together financially because of the lack of tips - and her own opinion: if you can't afford to pay AT LEAST 1$ tip, you can't afford the service itself.

FOR GOD'S AND YOUR OWN FUCKING SAKE

You mean if an employer can't afford to pay a decent wage, they shouldn't hire people. I can't stress how fucked up this ""if you can't afford to tip, you can't afford the service itself"" American bullshit mentality is. Blame your employers, your states' laws and the government running your country; protest if they don't guarantee what you're promised. They are supposed to pay you in the first place, not the ordinary people who work as much as you, maybe shittier jobs, get shittier wage, and can't even get tips because of the nature of their worm.

For context (Eastern European POV): Imagine getting paid 325 dollars a month for working at a WalMart like supermarket, 6 days out of 7, 12 hours a day. Then when you want to treat yourself with a pizza or get yourself new clothes, or an appliance breaks and you need a new microwave or some shit someone just starts scoffing about what a horrible asshole you are, because you didn't tip them for doing their job.

This mentality needs to be deleted, and replaced with: tipping is an OPTION for consumer, if you get tipped even one fucking cent, be GRATEFUL, because someone's giving you money from their own pockets besides what they have to pay, and if your financial situation sucks because of a system like this, start blaming the EMPLOYER, THE LAWS, AND THE GOVERNMENT. They are responsible, not your average joe who works as much, as gets a shitty wage as you do.

As long as they can do what they want with you, they will, and if you keep blaming each other instead of them, they will just profit more.

As many will attest to, the level of dad strength blue collar men tend to acquire in their mid to late thirties into their forties from a lifetime of fixing lawnmowers and trucks and working with their hands is nothing to be trifled with.  He's been shown to be able to kick through a chainlink fence and then deliver an immediate asskicking to Jimmy Wichard thereafter.

\-History of athletic prowess.  Hank may be past his absolute prime, but power is the last thing to go in a fighter.  In his football days, Hank almost took Arlen to state if not for his knee injury.  Hank was even known to be able to physically contend with Billdozer era Bill Dauterive, who could push several defensive linebackers and linemen all at once.  Hank may no longer be an athlete day to day, but those skills never fully leave.

\-Hank has delivered a number of asskickings through the series, demonstrating experience.  He clearly knows his way around physical confrontation.  He also used to practice boxing in his youth, showing a direct knowledge of fighting techniques, movement, angles, and striking.

\-Hank's genetics:  Hank's father, Cotton Hill, killed fifty men in World War II, and that warrior gene has likely been passed on to Hank, making him capable of extreme violence if turned on.

\-Hank's rage.  Hank has been shown a number of times to be able to turn into an unstoppable ragemonster in the series.  At one point he is shown to be able to manhandle both Dale Gribble and the large Bill Dauterive at the same time when angry.

Meanwhile:

\-John Redcorn never exhibits any tendencies or aptitude towards physical confrontation.  He routinely even tries to run away from Dale Gribble as not to be caught having sex with his wife.  While he previously worked as a security guard at concerts, he quit the job because it was physically too much for him, and that would not have been dealing with opponents who were former boxers/football players but instead just drunks.

\-He is a masseuse by trade, not a physical worker.  He seems to only have glamour muscles and never exhibits functional strength in any capacity.

\-He has been knocked out by Dale before.

\-John Redcorn on numerous occasions is shown to be a cowardly man, despite the facade of stoic strength he puts on.  Throughout the series there are many moments where he seems to choose the path of least resistance instead of making hard calls, and he is extremely emotionally fragile.

Overall, while John Redcorn may have scoffed at Hank's threat that he would kick his ass, all factors seem to point to Hank truly being able to physically manhandle John were he actually instigated too.  Should John ever heal Peggy in the way he heals the wives of others, it is undeniable that Hank would deliver an ass kicking upon John that his rear would never recover from.",2020-05-22 22:24:41,changemyview
CMV: Jojo's bizarre adventure is Really over rated &amp; hyped,"I will start by saying that I've read parts 1-7 before the anime started. Back then, it had a small niche fan base, and i had more spare time.


It wasn't an easy read by far. 
Some of it due to the poor scan quality available at the time (which was part of the fun, joking about it)

But mainly, because it just wasnt that good...
Even 10 years ago, the ""freak of the week"" style story was old as fuck.
Much of it was very underwhelming and forgettable, with most bad guys appearing and disappearing with next to no impact.

The story was super inconsistent, with the first 2 parts solely focusing on Ripple which was forgotten in favor of Stands. 
And I'm not even going into what was going on in part 7...

The art itself, while very fabulous, often made the manga too obscure and hard to follow.

Now, At some point, the anime was an announced. And it wasnt bad, but it reminded me how not good it was.

I dropped the anime in the 2nd part, occasionally tried to get back into it, but without success.

There's a huge following surrounding Jojo, and i just dont get it... I mean, visually, it can be very artistic and fabulous, but the story itself is, well... Kinda shit...

CMV:Linux is the best operating system for most people on their home computers.,"OK, so here's my story.

In the 80s i was into computers, I had a C64 as a kid and somewhere around 1990 my family got their first desktop. MS-DOS was the OS and as a kid I learned my way around it pretty quickly.  I loved the games etc... 

Eventually we added Windows 3.1 and then finally Windows95. We had Windows95 until I was out of high school.  It worked fine, I guess, for the time I had it.  During my senior year in high school a friend of mine had a Linux box that we would mess around with in the computer science class we took , ours was the first in the school and we were the only two kids in it. We basically got to do whatever we want. It was awesome. This was my first introduction to linux and while I liked it and thought the simple approach to permissions etc... was really cool I also knew it was not meant for any sort of regular household tasks and would never have tried to convince people to use it for anything practical.

I had windows through college, until I quit.  After quitting college I spent 10 years or so with no computer at all.  My life was focused on travelling and working and there just was no space for or reason to have a computer.

Fast forward to 2010, my wife and I had just moved into our first place after I put my wanderlust on the shelf.   We didn't want television but I did want to keep in touch with so many people I had met in my travels and we both wanted a way to watch movies.  I also play and record music from time to time.  We talked about it and eventually decided to buy an iMac.

We had that computer for 6 or so years and it finally broke. I have to say I was very impressed with it though it did cost quite a bit, over $2k I think.  

We had just had our first kid when it broke and so after thinking a bit about it decided to not spend that much and just buy a simple windows machine.  Brought it home, set it up, turned it on and it just totally sucked.  I hated the way it looked, it was constantly updating,  it was sluggish and not intuitive at all.  This was roughly 4 years ago.  

I decided I would just fork over the cash for a new iMac but not until after I gave Ubuntu a whirl just to see if it would work for us. I was honestly pretty apprehensive because of what I knew about it in the past.  My whole family has been using it ever since.  Ubuntu was a great starting point but Linux offers such a range of choices that it is difficult not to find something you like.   I find it to be nearly as intuitive as MacOS but with far greater access to the lower levels of computing if *and only if* you want to start learning about that stuff.  For everything my family does we have had literally 0 problems.  Streaming, gaming, all internet activities. to top it all off pretty much everything we ever use it for is totally *free*(like free beer).

I understand that for people that need professional access to certain software like the adobe suite or protools this might not be an option but for most people Linux is *easier and more intuitive* than windows while offering a much cheaper and more universally accessible option than Apple.",2020-05-22 20:14:51,changemyview
"CMV: Those who practice traditional martial arts or those that practice ""street specific"" fighting styles, or those who just subscribe to doing whatever it takes no matter how heinous of an act you'd do to a person don't have an advantage in a fight against a person that practices BJJ","For one, they think the practicioners of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu aren't practicing deadly scenarios.

Ok so breaking bones, twisting spines, and choking someone isn't deadly?

The only reason most BJJ practicioners aren't cripples or dead is because there is a tap out in place so they can keep practicing. 

What? Do traditional martial artists or street specific fighters actually stick their fingers into their training partners' eye sockets? Do they turn their training partners' balls into pudding? Do they really rip their training partners' throats off?

They also think that the fact that they do practice the dirty moves listed above and others like them gives them an advantage against a BJJ practicioner who practices none of those moves. 

The only way they'd actually have an advantage is if they have a gun, a knife, or a few buddies ready to gang up on their opponent.

But if all they have are their throat grabs, eye gouges, dick grabs, bites, and whatever deadly moves that they can do with their body, they're not really at an advantage.

For one, why would someone think that they can hit an eye easier than they'd be able to punch someone in the face?

The face and head is a gigantic target when you compare it to the eye. 

BJJ practicioners who's school focuses on self-defense have shown since their inception that they're able to avoid getting hit by punches and able to put themselves in positions where punches are so weak they're more annoying than damaging.

Why would someone think its easier to kick, punch, or grab a groin than it is to kick or grab a thigh or punch a stomach?

If BJJ practicioners can avoid that, and they have shown that they can, then it'll be easier to avoid any attempt at damaging their groins because again, the groin is a smaller target. 

These people also talk about going for those body parts when the BJJ practicioner grabs them.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, like all grappling is all about controlling your opponent's body. So why would someone think that they can just move their limbs freely against someone who is very good at controlling their body?

What? Do Kung Fu masters have the ability to make their limbs phase through another person's body like a ghost? Or will these people use their ""Chi"" to rip their opponents' throats off?

Finally, its a lot harder to make a BJJ practicioner release a choke or joint lock than they think. 

Getting choked and you grab a finger and try to break it so he lets go? 

Most chokes are done with closed fists, some are even done with legs, and the most popular choke, the rear naked choke, although its typically done with open fists can easily be done with closed fists as well.

And if the guy sees that you're going for his fingers while he's behind you choking you, what's stopping him from closing his fists?

The rear naked choke is not dependent on having open fists.

And why would someone think that they even have the time to try to grab fingers when they're being choked to death?

Movies make you think that being choked to death lasts for minutes. It doesn't. Especially when the person choking you knows exactly how to do it so that there is maximum blockage of blood from the brain. 

Ok then what about eye gouging, biting, or groin attacks when being choked or being put in a joint lock?

Successful or not in their attempt to do any of those things, if they don't KO the guy or kill him, then the guy will just make the choke tighter and therefore kill him faster or they'll just rip off whatever joint they were manipulating if they even had the courtesy to rip at it slowly in the first place.

That's the thing. In a fight to the death, an armbar for instance, doesn't last for multiple seconds because they're aren't waiting for a tap out in that scenario, they are doing that move with the intent to break that arm, so an armbar in a fight to the death only lasts for one second before that arm is broken.",2020-05-22 20:08:47,changemyview
"CMV: If someone states that research (especially if they say ""a study"" or ""studies"") has shown a given effect, they should be prepared to support this statement with a link or information to have the research they refer to, otherwise their claim has little validity.","Numerous times online, I see individuals saying that research has demonstrated certain findings, but when asked to provide a source or describe the study in sufficient detail for it to be searched up, they are unwilling to do so, often saying they do not want to put the effort in when the question asking for the source can do it themselves. When I have tried to look up valid sources, I have often found the preponderance of evidence actually speaks against their point, there is insufficient evidence, or there is little clear evidence to support them.  Sometimes I find a study that I assume they are referring to, but they are often aspects of the study design that mean it doesn't support their argument the way they probably think it does. Given the time it takes to find a study given little to no detail, the other user often does not respond to further commentary. I give the benefit of the doubt and assume they have moved on to other topics to discuss or are currently not online. However, I suspect some of the time they are not familiar enough with the topic to discuss further.

The problem with putting the onus to find the evidence on the person asking for it is that many people are making claims that are not valid. As most people do not follow a topic carefully or actually look up or appraise the data, this results in further spread of invalid claims, resulting in false beliefs in the community.

Ultimately, I believe that a person who makes a claim has to be prepared to back it up and if not, readers should be willing to assume the data is not there. This is how it works in all credible scientific research fields.",2020-05-22 18:31:50,changemyview
CMV: We should stop saying phrases like “My condolences to you” or “I’m sorry for your loss” because they’re said perfunctorily and not out of genuine empathy.,"I don’t intend for this post to come across as crass, but I believe that phrases along the lines of “I offer my heartfelt condolences to you” or “My condolences”, etc. are only said in response to someone else mentioning a loss or tragedy because people have been conditioned to say these phrases without any regard for how the other person actually feels. What the other person may be going through bears no effect on your life and you’ll more than likely go about your day without giving their emotions a second thought. What I think should be said instead are questions that show you genuinely want to support the person, such as: “How can I help you during this crisis?”, “Is there anything you need me to do?”, “Do you want to talk about it?”, etc.",2020-05-22 18:00:33,changemyview
CMV: Quantum computer will find no practical application for at least 30 years.,"**What do I mean by a ""practical application"":**

The quantum processor used as an irreplaceable component in solving a specific problem via a calculation or simulation. Not the whole calculation needs to be quantum, but it must have an essential quantum component. I explicitly exclude quantum random number generation and quantum protection in cryptography from this CMV.

Example: Simulating nitrogen fixation in nitrogenase as in [1]. Factorization of larger numbers than it is feasible with a classical computer, even if it's insufficient for a cryptographic attack.

Not an example: Using the classical numerical methods developed thanks to quantum computing research to solve the same problem. Discovery of new materials as a result of the quantum computing research, but not motivated by the calculation or simulation performed on a quatum processor.

**Why do I hold this view?**

I combine the estimated requirements for solving one of the smallest interesting problems [1], and the rate of progress between the two results considered to be milestones in the field [2,3]. The optimistic estimated requirement for simulating nitrogen fixation in nitrogenase to reasonable level of precision is that it requires at least 10^6 physical quibits with 10^-6 logical error rate per gate [1, Table 2, arbitrary selection of a column]. Between experiments [2] and [3], with publication dates of 2015 and 2019 the number of physical qubits increased from 9 to 53 (6-fold increase) and typical two-qubit gate error remained at about the same level (0.5-1.0%).

Assuming that number of physical qubits increases exponentially with the same rate (6-fold in 4 years) and that error rates also start improving (are reduced by half every 2 years) I estimate that the computation from [1] will be viable about year 2046, limited by how quickly the error rates can be reduced. Adding a few years for excessive optimism in reducing the error rates I round it up to 2050 (in 30 years).

Given how little the two-qubit gate error rates changed over last five years it still feels extremely optimistic.

**Why do I want this view changed?**

Because I want to be an optimist and believe that this technology could solve many of the problems in the world. Mostly through design of drugs, catalysts and other materials, I suppose.

**(Non-exhaustive) list of things that could (partially) change my mind:**

* concrete examples of practical problems that require much fewer quantum resources to perform the computation (but can't be solved classically)
* examples of sub-fields in quantum computing that show faster improvements than superconducting qubits
* concrete example of a bottleneck that slows down the progress at this time, but may be overcome in a near future leading to faster progress
* well-sourced argument that improvements in algorithms or quantum error correction will significantly reduce the resources needed for an useful computation
* etc.

Note: I work in experimental physics and very briefly dealt with proper quantum computing. You can assume I know the basic concepts but am unfamiliar with any except most famous papers. In case of any doubt dumb things down a bit for me (and for the benefit of other readers), but keep any references.

CMV: Manhunt is better than Tag,"Tag is a popular game found in schoolyards around the world. But I believe manhunt is an objectively superior variant of tradiional tag.

To reduce confusion, I will outline the rules of manhunt (at least the version I'm familiar with).

1. A person is chosen as the inital hunter (it).
2. Every person who is tagged joins the hunter's team and can tag the remaining players.
3. The game ends when all players have been tagged.

I believe this is better than tag because it incentivizes teamwork and is more inclusive.

## Teamwork

Tag is an individualist game. Like Manhunt, the objective for the hunted is just to not be tagged. This can be achieved most effectively in Tag by letting someone else be caught, but in Manhunt, every person caught becomes a new threat. Therefore, the hunted in Manhunt are incentivized to work together and protect the slower players. This can achieved by providing advanced warning, distracting the hunters, or helping with hiding.

This also goes for the hunters. Unlike in Tag, where there is only one hunter, there will eventually be more than one hunter. Hunters can work together to herd and corral targets. Hunters can also rotate chasing to wear down the faster targets. 

## Inclusive 

Manhunt is also more inclusive because players are more involved for longer. In tag, it's only ever one person chasing another. In Manhunt, hunters and hunted are constantly particpating in the chase. 

Manhunt is also more accepting of slower players. Even if they are tagged early, the slower players can still contribute meaningfully to their team. Using the aforementioned teamwork, slower players can bring down faster targets.

CMV: The Word “Please” and the Phrase “Thank You” are not equal in weight.,"Perhaps I’m biased because I formed a habit of saying “Thank You” while I don’t always say “please”. I don’t simply try to be rude, I just don’t think of it, while “Thank You” is pretty much automatic for me.

Here’s why I feel this way. Please can be used in begging or come off as needy, while thank you, at face value, can only be taken as gratitude. The tone matters between a genuine and sarcastic meaning of course, but when said genuinely, Thank You is usually considered genuine, while please can often be taken either as a request, or a beg.

Now, another reason. Say I ask a waiter/waitress to order me a dish. “May I have enchiladas?” “Yes, I’ll bring that right out when it’s finished.” “Thank you!” to most, is probably not considered rude. I’ve acknowledged and expressed gratitude towards their service. Whether or not I say please, in my opinion, doesn’t change the overall sentiment, while not saying thank you does. I’ve rarely heard people complain about someone not saying please if: 1. They said thank you 2. It was a request and not a demand.",2020-05-22 04:15:27,changemyview

- Deciding to pursue Ahmaud after the father and son had decided to pursue him is not an unreasonable thing to do. Based on the information that he had at the time, there is no reason to believe that the father and son is about to murder someone.  

- Deciding to videotape the incident not only helped the investigation, but it's what a responsible legal-minded person would do in that situation given that they were attempting to do something like a citizens arrest (albeit went extremely wrong).

CMV: Polyamory isn’t a part of the LGBT community,"Before I start, I’ll preface by saying that I am part of the LGBT community. I don’t know the exact ratio of people within the community that share my opinion, but it’s probably a 50/50 split. I’m here to look at different perspectives and potentially have my view changed.

So, from mine and most other people’s understanding, the LGBT community is a community for people within gender, sexual or romantic minorities.

Gender minorities refers to pretty much anyone who isn’t cisgender. This includes FtM, MtF, non-binary, and intersex people. I think that’s about it but I could be wrong.

Sexual minorities is to do with sexual attraction and refers to people who aren’t heterosexual. This includes gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, etc.

Romantic minorities is to do with romantic attraction which can be distinct from sexual attraction. For example, an asexual person could be biromantic. Romantic minorities refers to anyone who isn’t heteroromantic and includes homoromantic, biromantic, aromantic, etc.

I don’t see where polyamory fits in any of these categories. Being a very sex-positive community, the LGBT community definitely supports polyamorous relationships and they shouldn’t be demonised. I just don’t think that they’re inherently part of the community. You can obviously have LGBT individuals that are part of poly relationships, but I don’t see how that makes poly relationships in general a part of LGBT.

I don’t want to be unnecessarily exclusive against anyone who belongs in the LGBT community so if I am wrong I would prefer to know. As a pansexual, I know what it’s like for others within the LGBT community to be overly exclusive so I don’t want to be inflicting that that pain onto others.

"CMV: Games that claim to promote cognitive abilities, like Chess, are deeply flawed","
It is a fairly notorious and widely accepted theory that playing games that require deep cognitive abilities, like chess, help improve those abilities. For example, Joe Blitzstein asserts that chess improves one’s planning, problem-solving, deliberation and teaches you about hope and perseverance. Very noble corollaries of playing the game. 

However, I would like to argue that suggesting chess improves your foresight because it is required in the game is like suggesting you can learn how to fly by flapping your arms like a bird. It’s almost like the real thing, so it’ll basically work for the real thing, right? Not quite. The main factors that determine chess skills are chess-specific factors that are not transferable to other areas of life. Firstly, this means that being able to “predict and analyze the future” in chess does not necessarily improve your ability to do so in other activities in life. Also, conversely, not being able to do so in chess should no way negatively affect your ability to do so in real life. 

I call this the “Lumosity Effect”. The assumption that because you improve at a game, you must be improving at the things that underpin that game. A reasonable claim, but I simply find it a bit difficult to understand logically. Because you are improving at X, and X is similar to Y, you must therefore also be improving at Y? 

Don’t get me wrong, I honestly love chess and other brain games, and I find them much more preferable than mindlessly scrolling on social media. If anything, I’m hoping people here an change my view.

CMV: Purely Altruistic Motivation is Impossible.,"The definition I'm using for altruism stems from its Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article:

&gt;Behavior is normally described as altruistic when it is motivated by a desire to benefit someone other than oneself for that person’s sake. 

The article continues on with:

&gt;The term is used as the contrary of “self-interested” or “selfish” or “egoistic”—words applied to behavior that is motivated solely by the desire to benefit oneself. 

Yet, how is it contrary? The definition refuses to engage with the potential reasons why one desires that another benefits from one's actions. If another benefits as a result of one's actions, and one's actions were deliberate and their effects intended, then one has, on some level, wanted the other to benefit from one's actions. This implies a self-interested motivation, regardless of the tangibility of the manifestation of the self-interest.

Suppose, for example, I donate to a charity, intending to support a good cause. I reason that my disposable income would be better utilized by others—the utilitarian approach to value of currency.  Well, if I have a reason for donating in the first place, then this implies that I have a vested interest in the consequences of my actions, whether they be beneficial to others or not.

This scenario implies a number of possibilities, many of which are likely integrated into the decision to donate. First, my motivation is *still* selfish—I desire a particular result from my actions, and therefore, I am acting in a way which is self-serving, regardless of if I am benefiting in a tangible way. Perhaps it makes me feel good, or the donation places me in a lower tax bracket. Perhaps I want the charity to succeed in its endeavours. Regardless of the reason, the fact remains that I have acted in this way with a desired effect in mind, which originally motivated me to act.

For a natural example, consider a mother animal defending her young against a predator. The mother has a vested interest in preserving its kind—both evolutionarily, and individually. Clearly, her children benefit from the mother's actions, but this does not preclude the mother from acting in a non-altruistic way, as clearly the mother desires a particular result.

# Argument

A sentient being possesses at least one motivation, *M*, leading to an action, *A*. Altruism is predicated on some *M*. Therefore, any *A* is necessarily *A(M)*. Motivations are inherently self-serving, as motivation is intrinsic, though it may be influenced by both internal and external factors. Hence, *A(M)* is self-serving.

Clearly, this argument is not rigorous, and is open to challenge. The critical point I see is the axiom of every *M* being intrinsic. Personally, I believe the supporting evidence is compelling; at least, conscious actions must be made based on *some* motivation, and in a world with agency this implies some degree of individual subjectivity. As for altruism being predicated on some *M*, this comes from the aforementioned definition of altruism. We can also see that agency is a requirement for altruism, and agency requires some level of conscious subjective analysis.

# Altruism Redefined

In light of the above, I propose an alteration to the SEP's definition:

&gt;A behaviour is considered altruistic when one's motivations lead one to act in such a way where the goal is to benefit others in a particular way, with no expectation of a tangible reward, determined by what the altruistic agent considers tangible.

This definition allows for the presence of altruism regardless of the presence of intangible rewards, including positive feelings. Note that the SEP's definition would be compatible with mine if it were not for the immediate continuation, which clearly states the use-case of altruism and its negation. The notion of pure altruism, as is given by the SEP, is ultimately what I am challenging.",2020-05-21 23:52:36,changemyview
CMV: Graduating isn’t an accomplishment.,"Unless you have a severe learning disability, it’s not hard to graduate high school or college. It literally just requires you to pass all of your classes. And don’t get me started on kindergarten and middle school graduations. It’s not some kind of accomplishment to get literal passing grades. Getting great grades and academic awards is an academic accomplishment because it requires a lot of effort to be put into your studies. Graduating just requires passing all of your classes. 

Getting a C in a class (unless it’s some high level math or science class) isn’t hard. Just put some effort into your work and turn it in on time and study a bit before exams and you’ll be fine. Basically if you put effort into your studies, you’ll pass. Most people agree that getting a C isn’t an accomplishment. Most people equate getting Cs with failure. The minimum requirements for graduating are getting a C. Because the minimum requirements to graduate are so low and easy to achieve unless your a slacker or you have a severe learning disability or mental problems that prevent you from being a successful person, achieving graduation isn’t an accomplishment.",2020-05-21 23:44:29,changemyview
CMV: Australia should be able to conceal carry a weapon for self defence," Australia should be allowed to carry a weapon for self defence. Whether this be pepper spray, tazer or a small 9mm. Especially women who cannot defend themselves from someone twice their body weight. There is only so much self defence can teach you before someone 100 kg can over power someone 50 kg.

Australia is currently not allowed to carry ANYTHING for a self defence weapon and the citizens can be fined for carrying/using anything in self defence. You are not allowed to have any form of weapon to defend your home also. You can be charged if you use for instance, a bat to remove an intruder from your property. If they were not attacking you, only stealing your stuff, you cannot use a bat to remove them from your property.

Being able to carry at the minimum, pepper spray, would allow citizens to prevent or deter muggings, rapes and other crimes from occurring if people were able to defend themselves from criminals.

As a woman, I would feel more comfortable being able to conceal carry my CZ when I walk home at night rather than clutching my keys in hope I can defend myself from a potential assault.

CMV: Reinstating a draft system would make the nation more politically responsible.,"I'm absolutely NOT trying to belittle the efforts of past or present military personnel! I can't understand everyone's reasons/motivations. I know there are currently countries with mandatory military service (I'd love to hear your opinions also, if you live in one of them). I'm not a political scientist and honestly I avoid that branch of philosophy because it mostly doesn't make sense to me (or it makes too much sense, sometimes, rarely). I'm not saying joining the military is equivalent to wanting combat. I know I'm young(ish) and ignorant of these hidden ways of governance. I can see that there would be people of an altruistic nature, who go so that others don't have to. This is the disclaimer to my very basic ideology.

That being said, here are my concerns with the American military system.

1. I understand that subjecting oneself to combat is not a light decision. People who have done so definitely deserve more benefits than are currently in place for them, and plenty of respect. (But) the system of reduced pay for college education being a motivator to enlist even in the reserves doesn't seem like a good idea. I imagine many people would decide to enlist just for these types of benefits (I even considered it myself, but I'm a pathetic wimp). The problem is in the consequences of being eligible for combat, which should be the primary deciding factor rather than an afterthought or ""what-if"". I don't have stats on anything, sorry if I'm doing this CMV wrong.
2. If there were the possibility for ANYONE to be subjected to the decisions of governing authorities and have to personally risk their lives, we would care more about where we place our support and see the impact of our political decisions (like voting). I don't see anything wrong with wanting to DEFEND your nation. It's good to love your country (in a way that doesn't hurt others or impact their freedom). But from my (limited) perspective it seems like we would be less inclined to resort to such drastic actions if it had a deeper impact on our daily lives. We couldn't ignore things and say ""I'll leave it to the people that decided to join the military"". A sense of brotherhood is necessary, but it shouldn't be a club you join of your own volition.

CMV: America needs to change to metric measurement system &amp; Celsius temperatures like the rest of the world,"America is one of the only countries left that still use this old measurement system and I don't understand why they haven't already converted over.

Metric measurements are 100% easier to use and calculate:

*10000 millimetres to a Metre*

*1000 metres to a kilometre* 

*1000 grams to a kilogram*

*1000 kilograms to a ton*

Where as imperial measurements are all over the joint:

*12 inches to a feet*

*3 feet to a yard*

*1760 yards to a mile*

*16 ounces to a pound*

Same goes for the Celsius and Fahrenheit measurement of temperature. 

For Celsius, water freezes at 0 degrees and water boils at 100. Below 0 is getting cold, above 0 is getting hotter.

Fahrenheit measurement, water freezes at 32 degrees and water boils at 212 degrees. 

I feel like the Imperial/Fahrenheit measurements just picked random numbers to start at and equal to which makes it difficult to follow and calculate easily.

CMV: If Black Lives Matter is interested in preserving black lives they should be focused primarily on getting better healthcare for black communities and working on homicide prevention,"I understand that BLM is their own movement and they can focus on whatever they want. I also understand that they're involved in more than just protesting against the unjust killing of innocent black men. That said, that is and always has been the primary focus of BLM; it's what they get attention for from the media, it's what all their largest protests are focused on, and it is both what founded the movement and skyrocketed it to international fame. 

I believe that **if BLM is actually interested in maximizing their efforts to save as many black lives as possible** this is the wrong priority structure. This is not to say that they can't continue to work in opposition to the unjustified shootings of young black men, but their primary focus should instead be on healthcare and homicide. 

[Per the CDC's stats](https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/lcod/men/2016/nonhispanic-black/index.htm) blacks face the pretty typical litany of medical issues as the leading cause of death (I realize these are stats for males, but BLM has always focused primarily on male-centric issues; in the same vein I'm aware this whole post focuses on issues of fatality but then again so does BLM currently, so that seems fair). Where the black community suffers disproportionately is that they are less likely to be medically insured and they [often report receiving worse treatment](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/racism-discrimination-health-care-providers-patients-2017011611015) and [statistics seem to back up the fact that they do](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/the-state-of-healthcare-in-the-united-states/racial-disparities-in-health-care/). 

It would be fairly impossible for me to try and calculate just how many black people die or have their quality of life reduced due to inadequate medical care, but given that medical issues are so prevalent in terms of leading causes of death it's probably not to controversial to say it's at least in the thousands or tens of thousands range.

Now homicide is somewhat unique in the black community. Per the CDC it's the fourth leading cause of death for black men of all ages and the single leading cause of death for black men ages 1-19 and 20-44. This is not even vaguely comparable to the plight of homicide in any other demographic. As for the exact number per year, I've found some discrepancies based on the year and the agency tracking those stats, but it seems safe to say it's in the 6000-7000 range, ballpark. 

Now lets look at fatal police shootings of unarmed black men. The highest number I've seen in any given recent year was reported by [WaPo in 2015 at 36](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/the-57375-years-of-life-lost-to-police-violence/559835/). Now of course that's just stats for blacks shot while unarmed, and not all unarmed shootings are unjustified (see Michael Brown), and that's also the highest estimate I've found, but lets take it and assume it's normal. 

Homicide, healthcare issues, and fatal police shootings are all human caused problems that end black lives. So per year:

If Black Lives Matter solves the issue of homicide they will save thousands of black lives lives. 

If Black Lives Matter solves the issue of poor healthcare they will save thousands of black lives. 

If Black Lives Matter solves the issue of unjustified, fatal police shootings of innocent black men they will save, at best, 36 black lives, and in all likelihood more like 5-10. 

If maximizing the efforts to save black lives is not a priority for Black Lives Matter they are of course free to continue expending a whole bunch of time, energy, and international attention primarily combating an issue that only affects a tiny, vanishingly small percentage (if I'm doing my mental math right something in the area of hundred thousandths of a percent) of the black community. And that's their right and their business. 

If, on the other hand, Black Lives Matter want to maximize saving as many black lives as possible, they should focus on healthcare and homicide.",2020-05-21 21:50:27,changemyview
"CMV: If you opt out of being an organ donor, you shouldn't be eligible to receive a transplant unless you PERMANENTLY opt back in.","I've yet to hear a good argument against this but I'm hoping to find one.

I live in England and since yesterday every adult is now an organ donor unless they choose to opt out. I respect it's a personal choice to opt out of organ donation, though I also think the reverse should be true. You shouldn't take something you aren't willing to give. 

We're not talking about giving wealth or time that you could enjoy instead. You're dead, you've got no use for those organs and they could save someone's life or at least give them a better quality of life. My exception is if someone needs a transplant at short notice and there's an organ available e.g. if someone is in an accident and needs a transplant ASAP and there's a organ that isn't needed elsewhere, then use it to save their life. But if you need to be added to a transplant list, then you shouldn't be eligible unless you're willing to donate when you die. 

Also if religion is your reason not to donate organs BUT you'd still be willing to receive one, either you suck or your religion sucks. 

Finally, please ignore the logistics of enforcement, the black market, whether you'd be medically able to donate organs if you've already received one etc. I'm looking for a logical personal/moral view on why someone would be willing to take an organ but would choose to opt out of giving one.",2020-05-21 21:28:43,changemyview
CMV: Chinese 'Belt and road' imperialism is more humane than American imperialism.,"A lot of people are critical and suspicious of the Chinese 'Belt and Road' programme, which gives loans and builds infrastructure around the world to that supports the Chinese strategy  of being the center of trade. 

The common argument is that China is making countries indebted to them, which then gives them control over that country later on. 

Now I won't dispute that China is a rising power looking to increase its influence about the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

However: if we look at the role the US has had post WWII, and what its done in pressing

 its interests, it tends to be things like:

\- Supporting drug cartels

\- Supplying weapons 

\- Supporting the overthrow of democratically elected leaders in favour of dicators that favour their interests. 

\- Outright invading countries.

Whereas the Chinese approach is writing cheques and building infrastructure.

"CMV: Americans on Reddit assuming that everyone else on Reddit is American is unfair, thoughtless, and borderline offensive to non-Americans.","So I see this a lot, for example [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/gns6ga/oc_most_popular_television_series_1951_2019/). The post neglects to mention that it is USA-centric, and the OP either assumes that it’s obvious it’s American-based or doesn’t think. As a non-American, it annoys me that I see this attitude a lot.

I do understand that a significant majority of traffic on Reddit is from the USA, but for me it’s still unfair to assume that everyone is in the US and automatically associates everything with the US. It wouldn’t be difficult, I think, to just spend a few words saying “In the USA...” or “data relating to the USA”. I find it really annoying when the OP of a post or comment assumes that everyone will know that they’re talking about America and doesn’t briefly mention that.

The other issue I have is that the reverse isn’t true; that is any non-American Redditor is automatically assumed to be American unless they’re on an obviously non-American subreddit (eg. r/BritishProblems and similar). I have had to explain multiple times that I’m from the UK at people’s confused comments and such, and it annoys me. 

Most of the news subreddits are heavily USA-centric as well, and while it’s understandable due to the nature of the site why these get more upvotes (Americans are the majority of traffic, after all), it annoys me once again the unspoken assumption that everyone wants/needs to hear about *American* news first and foremost, regardless of where they are.

TL;DR - The USA is considered the de facto default country on Reddit. Even though it’s understandable, it annoys me as I think Reddit shouldn’t have a default country, be it unofficial or otherwise.

"CMV: Internet access should be a required school supply for high school students, just like pencils and binders.","I am a high school teacher in a rural area, and the school shut down has been a mess for our district. Most of our students are doing work online, but many students don't have computers, don't have internet, or their internet is too slow for all the people in the house to do the work they need to do. So we've been sending packets of work home every two weeks, and most of this had not been returned it was returned blank. Even when work has been returned I can't give timely feedback on it.

Even before the shut down, internet access has been an issue. My homework assignments can't be based online, or they have to be modified for specific students without access. Many students try to use this as an excuse to not do work, instead of doing it during study hall where they have access. They also say that their parents don't have time to take them to the library after school.

When I started high school in 2006 (the same school I'm teaching at), my parents got us dial-up internet. I was expected to type and print essays for school and sometimes those essays needed online research. It was assumed that if you couldn't do it at home, you would go to the school library during study hall or to the public library after school. That was over 10 years ago, and internet is now even more integral to learning.

I know that the biggest argument against this is going to be cost. I pay $60/month for internet, which is a monthly bill some families can't handle. But shouldn't schooling be made a priority? Parents make sacrifices for their children all the time; this seems like a thing parents should be willing to fit in the budget.

If the money is really an obstacle, parents should be expected to get their kids to the library to use a computer. Schedules may need to be arranged or another person may have to take them, but, again, parents make sacrifices.

CMV: You make your own path in life regardless of external factors.,"Disclaimer: I have lived a pampered life compared to a lot of my peers and partners in the past and current relationships. Potentially making me ignorant  in this situation.

Let me start off by giving some background, Young Male, come from a middle class, healthy and close-knit family. Vacations were annual, I had debt and school paid for by my parents and was left a nest egg that I got after graduating. I have little to no real life experience in terms of drug, physical or mental abuse.

I believe that your life is in your hands and you make due with the hand you've been dealt. I don't really believe depression, anxiety, or suicide. This toxicity of the mind affects an individual depending on their mental stamina and the support they receive from friends or family. 

While there are definately moments in life that make things difficult or simple I am yet to hear a convincing argument that no matter the odds it's up to you and you alone to choose your destiny. Life is just a bunch of yes and no's and it's your choices in life that develop you as a person and it's the people that invest in themselves that always succeed. 

Let's start with intelligence because there is a biological factor in play but like any skill if you spend time at it you will see improvements. Proper education can be attained. If you can't afford it work hard in high school so it's paid for you. If your good at a sport secondary school will pay for everything. The point I'm trying to make and it will be a repeating pattern, you have to make due with what you have, recognize your weaknesses and work on them and recognize your strengths and exploit them.

Family and friends are another important factor. Something that's always stuck with me is that you are the average of your choices in people you socialize with. Why can't people see that others are dragging them down I believe they can for the most part. This is where self-worth comes into play which can be affected by the environment around you but you can choose your environment once in adulthood. Surrounded by drugs, leave. Been surrounded by drugs your whole life then of all people you should understand the potential downfall that comes with addiction as you've seen it first hand.

Career choice, there are arguments that connections are necessary now a days to succeed but if your parents bummed around then it's up to you. There is a science to being liked and also a process for success in any industry. Be the master of whatever you want to do and the easiest way to do that is enjoy what you do. No one made you work at Walmart as a bagger until your retirement comes and you have no savings. You chose that life. You deemed it acceptable and the cycle kept going up until it is too late. That's your fault. Some of the most wealthy people in the world, entrepreneurs and innovators in every industry have had rough upbringings. Often they utilize their unique experiences as fuel to get them out of rutts that they may have started out in but once it gets easy and it always will eventually if you give it 100 % it really gets easy to those that started with less than nothing because they've basically been conditioned their entire life.

Now this is about the time where I get called ignorant because I've never experienced any of these setbacks. Its offensive sometimes and upsetting that because you haven't been scarred for life or grew up with no money that the accomplishments you've made in your life are downplayed. Something that I can guarantee is that those people don't understand the pressure and expectations placed on you to succeed just because you got a headstart or an easy upbringing. Ive grinded my ass off to get good grades in university, networked a shit ton in my dream career and consistently beat my boss's expectations of me to rocket me through promotion after promotion until I'm one of the youngest in the profession.

I'm open minded to opinions and criticism since I've  likely said a lot of things that will trigger some people so don't worry about my feelings I just want to see if there's something I'm missing.

It seems perfectly reasonable to some to make ludicrous broad sweeping generalizations when it suits their argument - even when the statement is clearly based on anecdotes or rare incidents.

"CMV: Murder in the United States should be a federal crime, not a state crime","I’ve been doing quite a bit of research into race relations in the United States, and one of the consistent examples of systemic racism is the handling of murder cases and trials in smaller communities (see: Just Mercy for many examples of this phenomenon). The unfortunate reality is that once you are convicted, it is almost impossible for that conviction to be reversed, unless very specific violations occurred during the events leading up to the trial and the trial itself. 

I specifically point out murder because it is the only capital offense (meaning death can be sentenced as punishment) that is allowed to be decided by individual states. I believe this allows for individual prejudices and community prejudices to have undue influence over the criminal justice system, and in this instance, people’s literal outcomes. 

It is my belief that we need to change our system and have murder suspects (specifically first-degree murder) face an unbiased jury of their peers. In this system, we would still have the individual states present their case as the prosecution, but the jury and the judge would be federally appointed, and the case would be tried in a neutral place. We would also have to formulate a federal statute with regard to murder. 

It seems rather common sense, and an easy way to eliminate nefarious and biased court proceedings that quite literally result in death. What am I missing here?",2020-05-21 17:25:21,changemyview

My view is that **anyone** can be taken advantage of no matter what the industry is &amp;amp; it is not ridiculous to say so. This individual made it about men being taken advantage by women. I believe that can absolutely happen. It can also happen with men to men, men to women and women to women.

It doesn’t matter if the service or product is in a grey area or flat out illegal (sex or or drug dealing) or if it is completely legal (prescribing drugs or lending money).

Does anyone truly believe that a prostitute or stripper do not target certain individuals to get what they want? Did a famous female rapper not admit to drugging men and robbing them when she was a stripper? Was there not a movie based on actual events of strippers targeting certain men to benefit themselves? 

Are women who chase male athletes, singers actors or anyone with a certain net worth selling their physical being for monetary gain?

Do you think certain women would pursue Todd in the hardware section at Homedepot the same way as Roger the 6’9” Duke starting power forward? 

The definition of predatory: seeking to exploit or oppress others.

So yes... man or women, someone can be selling sex (as a profession or not) and prey/hunt after a specific clientele. Just how some money lending institutions that charge 35% interest seem to find themselves in less affluent areas. A woman/man looking to get more out of certain individuals and purposely targeting them is nothing uncommon. So it is not a ridiculous thing to claim. I am not saying it is right or wrong. I am not saying the opposite party doesn’t have their hands clean either. I am saying it can and undoubtedly does happen.

**The ""freedom"" that Democracy offers us is largely an illusion.** There was a quote I remember that ""To control a people, don't restrict debate - instead, let them debate vigorously within a very small window of acceptable opinions."" 

That perfectly sums up what we have today. There's no real power for anyone dissatisfied with the system to change anything. vigorous ""debates"" are only held with regard to pre-determined, largely stupid and pointless topics. Entire topics are off-limits and get you fired/""shut down""/""cancelled"" if you even bring them up (the government doesn't even have to censor people, private-sector censorship is so effective now). We're largely not allowed to debate any of the real issues that will doom this country, they keep that under lock and key. Back to debating gun control and abortions and tax returns and if we should allow 100k or 40k immigrants this year, goy.

There are forces at work here that can't really be countered by voting. IE, our demographic replacement. It's a numbers game. There's nothing I can do as an individual voter or as a collective of voters to do anything when the powers that be keep shifting the numbers more and more in their favor, by letting central americans come here and making their kids citizens as soon as they touch our soil.

When you look back to history at the cases where a giant mess like this was successfully cleaned up (Hitler, Pinochet, etc) it was never done with Democracy. Democracy lacks the ability to do it.

Now I'm reluctant to support this because I like my freedom, but I fear that the ""freedom"" I have is just an idea that was sold to me by the brainwashing schools. We don't really have any in this Democratic system. The thoughts of the dumb-as-rocks public are controlled by the cosmopolitan media and music and political industry, and because everything is a numbers game, a smart individual has no power to do anything about it.

CMV: No democrat can beat Trump in 2020,"Despite the Democrats having more than 25 candidates at one time, I don’t think any of them can beat Donald Trump. Not one. After Bernie dropped out, I saw people saying that he was the only candidate that could’ve beat Trump but at the end of the day, he couldn’t even beat Biden. 

Now that Biden is the candidate, I don’t see him finding a way to beat Trump. It’s hard for the incumbent to lose to the opposing party after just 1 term. The last time it happened was George H.W Bush and that was after we had Reagan in power for 8 years. It was about time for a Democrat to get back into office. After Obama being in office for 8 years and Trump for 4 years, he’ll have another 4 to go. 

Since Trump has been in office, primary numbers have been massive. Trump received 31,000 votes in the 2020 primaries in Iowa surpassing Obama’s 25,000 in 2012. 

In New Hampshire, Trump recieved 129,696 votes more than doubling Obama and Bush’s totals. This is happening even though Trump doesn’t have a formidable primary challenger. 

In a key state like Florida, Trump was able to lockdown 1,162,854 votes by himself while 16 democrats picked up roughly around 1.7 million votes and that’s if all of those votes stay for Biden in November. 

In Wisconsin, Trump picked up 617,000 votes while democrats picked up roughly 950,000. 

While this all been going on, Republicans were able to turn the CA-25th district Red for the first time since 1998 when Clinton was in office. 

In 2018, Republicans were able to gain in the senate while Democrats were able to only gain in the House. In 2012, Obama lost both the House and Senate.

CMV: Affirmative Action is just Reverse Racism,"While I understand the importance of diversity and inclusiveness, it seems that affirmative action is not the correct answer. Affirmative Action ultimately closes doors for more qualified individuals just based on their race, sex, ethnicity. 

Recently, the NFL has moved to change the Rooney Rule to give more draft incentives to organizations that hire and interview more ethnic-minority candidates. This is wrong. Why should someone get an interview or job just based their ethnicity? Isn’t that what racism seeks to end?

My other example that comes to mind is the story of a student who tried getting into the University of Texas at Austin. I may have messed up some details, but I believe this is the gist of it. This student was valedictorian of their high school and applied to the school and did not get accepted. This student then sued the school citing affirmative action as the cause as to why they did not get accepted. The student’s argument was that they were more qualified than students that were accepted because of affirmative action. The state or college, can’t remember, instead of reevaluating affirmative action, just decided that if you are in the top 10% of your class, you will get accepted.

First of all, I'm talking about mainstream country. I'm aware that there are artists out there who still play country music and some of that may even be kind of popular but most of it is not country music. To me it seems like every singer that has a southern accent is put on the country radio these days. 

I'm not that familiar with music theory or anything but I don't think I have to be to claim that this stuff isn't country music. I have heard some songs that have some elements of country music in it like a steel guitar for example but it still doesn't sound like country music to me. Country isn't the only thing you can play on a steel guitar and country isn't the only genre you can sing as a southern guy. And I know music genres can evolve but it should at least sound a little bit like what the genre used to be. 

I don't even have anything against the music these guys make. It's not my thing but it's alright, that's not what I mean. But I just don't get why you gotta call it country music. It is pop music, that's it. I wouldn't even call it ""pop country"" or something like that cause I just can't seem to find any similarities.

—We are stronger and safer prioritizing coexisting &gt; fighting  

2. *Use perspective*  
—Everything‘s only from each person's own perspective  

3. *Be open to changing your view*  
—Would you rather be as accurate as you can or be right?  

4. *No talking over each other*  
—Let them know if they're losing your attention  
—Be concise, or no one will want to listen  

5. *0 support for self-victimization*  
— The victim who is able to articulate their situation of victimhood is no longer a victim.  If you’re unwilling to further articulate your situation, then you are part of your problem.  
— I'll listen to anyone vent anything as long as they agree to start trying to fix it with me whenever they're done venting so they don't have to keep feeling that way.  

6.  *Our core of common humanity*  
—If you look deep enough to the core reasons for our behaviors, we want the same things underneath.  Most fights, arguments, &amp; disagreements are simply misunderstandings of this.  
—So if I disagree about something, first ask them to better explain their perspective and listen for the common humanity at the core of it instead of just assuming my interpretation is correct so I can feel right.

There is nothing from stopping Jeff Bezos from selling all of his stock except himself. Also, couldn't they be taxed every two weeks or a month like everyone else with a paycheck so it's not some annual mass sell off?

CMV: The practices of marriage are important tools for a successful society and ought not be eroded.,"Marriage is not just a wedding day but rather a lifelong active exercise in growing a loving relationship with one's spouse.  Humanity has developed thousands of years worth of concepts, rules, etc. to guide spouses. Most of those rules boil down to practicing patience and kindness towards your spouse before engaging in your own pleasures. 

When individuals become a couple without making a meaningful promise to seriously attempt the practices described above, they do not set themselves up for success. In this context I am defining success as a long lasting environment of love between the spouse's from which the children of the relationship can benefit. 

To be clear, it is not required that one have a religious ceremony or a ceremony at all in order to promise to bind oneself to certain rules.  Some people get married flippantly, and some non-married people dedidacate their lives to their common-law spouse. In my view, the latter is the better of the two.

Some detriments of engaging in romantic partnerships without engaging in the practices described above are:
- easier to succumb to selfish desires and ulrimately hurt the other spouse
- increased likelihood of creating a poor environment for children to grow up in. Ultimately, more criminals.
- court system overrun by family law disputes (waste of taxes) 

Given that romantic partnerships are apparently a part of human existence, there should be a greater focus on educating people on the successful practices of romantic partnerships.

"CMV: There wouldn’t be such a stigma against fatty foods, if “fat” (the caloric source) did not share the same word as the adjective of a person being “fat”.","So fats, are just another source of calories, just like protein and carbohydrates (sugars). Yet fats get a really bad rap because they are associated with being fat. Yet, a person can consume almost no fat in their diet, yet still become fat if they consume too many calories from other sources. Think cows. Their diet consisted almost exclusively of grass, yet they can get quite fat.

Yes, your body processes different types of calories differently (protein, carbs, and fats are all processed by your body a little bit differently), but at the end of the day, a person becomes fat of they are taking in more calories than they are burning.

A few months back, I started the low-carb keto diet, and have actually lost weight while having a diet that consists of far more fatty foods than I used to. Because again, fats are just another form of calories, and as long as you are burning more calories than you take in, you will lose weight.

In my experience, lots of carbohydrates are far more indicative of gaining weight, yet there isn’t widespread stigma against carbs.

So my view is that fatty foods have such a stigma because of the association of the noun “fat” with the adjective “fat”. People are often far more concerned about a piece of food being high in fat than they are about apiece or food being high in carbs, even if the piece of food high in carbs has far more overall calories.

If for example, we started calling fats something else, like “lipids”, there wouldn’t be such a stigma against eating foods containing lipids.

Likewise, if the condition of being overweight was called something like being “carby” and having lots of “stored carbs” around your gut, there would be a much greater stigma around eating carbs, instead of fats.

The government having more power to allocate capital is a good thing and leads to higher economic growth because the governments incentive is to grow the economy (bigger economy, more tax revenue) so the government will spend money on things like education (a smarter population contribute more to economic growth) improving healthcare (ill people don't contribute as much to economic growth) long term infrastructure (the kind of projects individuals and companies don't have the capability or will to do), etc. etc.

Giving more power to allocate capital to companies hurts economic growth because large companies are incredibly inefficient and short-term in their thinking (try working in one). Companies incentive is to squeeze as much cash out of the economy as quickly as possible by investing as little cash as possible to then give returns to shareholders (individuals). They have no incentive to fuel long term economic growth.

Giving more power to individuals to allocate capital hurts economic growth because the average individual has no incentive (and would rarely think) to fuel long-term economic growth. The average individual either hoards their wealth or will just assign capital to what they desire to buy at any particular point in time.",2020-05-21 09:07:18,changemyview
CMV: I should vote for Howie Hawkins (Green candidate) in the US presidential election,"Trump is repugnant, let's be clear. In his policies, however, Trump is much closer to Biden than Biden is to Bernie, Merkel, Jeremy Corbyn or any comparable European candidate. The democratic establishment has a interest in the success of someone who acts repugnant being the republican candidate. This makes it easy for them to put forward a candidate one level ""less"" corrupt than the republican candidate; it removes the incentive for them to try to appease the progressive wing. This is because they are constrained to vote for the dem candidate no matter who it is. The neoliberal wing can effectively ignore everyone outside of the establishment in this way.

""If you call yourself a true progressive you'll do everything you can to prevent Trump's election.""

A similar argument was being floated in 2000. Bush was unquestionably a bigger tragedy as a president than Trump because of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan which continue in some form to this day, as well as the expansion of the torture facilities at Guantanamo Bay. Multiple hundreds of thousands of people were killed as a direct result of wars began in the first term of Bush Jr, which for me takes precedent over the ugliness of Trumps' behavior, no matter how inflammatory it is. So the emerging pattern is every election, the moderate wing says ""(GOP candidate) is basically Satan, you're either with us or against us, most important election of our lifetime"" yadda yadda yadda, their candidate loses and they blame it on progressives rather than on their own shitty candidate, and the democratic party never has to evolve. 

The only possible way to get the dems to listen to us it to make them realize we don't ""owe them"" a vote, an attitude which illustrates the deeply-entrenched entitlement of the neoliberal wing. Change my view!",2020-05-21 09:01:09,changemyview
"CMV: Calling creative works ""good"" or ""bad"" is bad communication and should be avoided in rational discourse","The following is about creative works of any genre or medium, be it literature, music, film or other.

We like to judge works as ""good"" or ""bad"". This can be fine in informal chitchat, but in any serious discussion it should be avoided.

When a work is called ""good"", it can mean one or more of the following:

1. It is enjoyable (completely subjective).
2. It is thought-provoking or instructive (highly subjective).
3. It is enjoyable, thought-provoking or instructive to many (popularity). 
4. It is enjoyable, thought-provoking or instructive to many people in a special group whose opinions on the matter are considered especially important (critical/scholarly acclaim). 
5. It remains enjoyable, thought-provoking or instructive to many people long after its creation (enduring popularity). 
6. It obeys a set of ""rules"" for the medium in question (e.g., accurately hitting music notes and rhythms, a logically consistent plot, character growth).
7. It is or was influential in its medium or genre (historical significance).
... and possibly more things that I didn't think of.

The above 7 points are completely different. They may be statistically correlated, sure, but they remain very separate things. So when one person calls a work ""good"" he's saying ""this work has some unspecific combination of the above"". When another person calls the same work ""bad"" he's saying ""this work is lacking in one or more of the above"".

If I'm just chatting casually with my friends and I say ""_Power Rangers_ is awesome"" or ""William Blake is awesome"", that's acceptable, because everyone can figure out I'm probably talking about meaning 1 or 2. But if I want to argue that William Blake is _better_ than _Power Rangers_ or vice versa, then I need to specify exactly which points I'm talking about.

I'm not saying that calling things good or bad is meaningless. I'm saying it is bad communication. It confuses more than it communicates, especially since people get emotionally attached to the notion of ""good"" or ""bad"". Therefore I think people shouldn't use it.

When reading my list above you may nod sagely. But I will claim that most people don't truly get it. When people argue and get angry or smug about which things are good and bad, it's because they don't truly understand what they're talking about. They do truly understand how ambiguous their terms are; they think that ""objective goodness"" is really one thing, and the other guy just gets it wrong. 

An example is the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft. One reader can claim that Lovecraft is a ""good"" writer because he satisfies points 5 and 7. Another can argue Lovecraft is a ""bad"" writer because he fails points 4 and 6. They can keep arguing and miscommunicating because they don't realize they're talking about different things. 

People communicate badly because they've been taught to think in terms of ""good"" and ""bad"". That's why, in serious discourse, people should stop doing it.",2020-05-21 08:37:03,changemyview
"CMV: If you allow yourself to be trapped in a toxic relationship, you don't get to complain","**I know this is a triggering topic, here I am here so you can educate me and change my view.**

For over 10 years, my good friend has been complaining to me about how controlling and terrible her husband is. It started when they were dating, and she raised red flags about him raising his voice at her and denying her from having male friends other than the ones who are his friends/acquaintances.

He was my classmate from school years ago, and although we rarely talk, we know each other so I ""qualify"" as a friendship she's allowed to keep.

A year later after they got engaged, she whined to me privately about how he was such an asshole at times, and she wasn't sure if this was the right move. I outright told her that if she's asking that kinda question, she should hold off the marriage

Welp, they got married anyway, and as you can expect, year after year she moans about how he yells at her, belittles her, controls her every action etc etc. My advise has always been the same: this is the man she chose; if she can't work things out with him, then divorce him. Her reply is always: Well I am sure I can change him OR I still love him! And besides we have kids!

He puts her down with words like, ""Stupid woman, I am in charge here!"" or ""No one wants you. You are in your middle-age!"" or ""You are NOTHING without me!""

Nearly everyday, she whines to me about how restrictive it is, how she can't take it anymore etc etc. I am sick and tired of hearing her complain. Already, her **son** is learning from the father's example and back-talking to her. When I told her that this was because she was too weak to walk away or to stand her ground, she cried and hung up.

Yes I feel bad. But I feel worst for her children who would grow up in a such an environment. I feel bad for them for having such a weak-willed mother.

CMV: The US national debt will probably never be paid off and will forever increase. It shouldn't be used as an excuse to not increase the minimum wage and implement free or more affordable healthcare.,"When the topic of increasing the US minimum wage or implementing free or more affordable healthcare comes up, I've heard a common point coming from mostly Republicans that I've talked to. ""Where is that money going to come from? We're already trillions of dollars in debt and cannot afford to make changes like that without ruining our economy."" Stuff like that.

If we're already trillions in debt, and it's just going to keep getting worst and worst, then why even bring it up? As far as I know, we're always going to be in debt. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but isn't gov. spending already exceeding our profits, meaning that we will never pay it off? And if our debt is never going to go away, then why can't we just ignore it and make these changes anyway for the sake of the people? 

What consequence would the United States face for just ceasing to give a fuck about the debt? By asking this question, I'm not saying that the US should stop paying its debt. I'm just saying that maybe we should just give up on paying it off, and we should accept that being in crippling debt is a part of the American dream (Sarcasm). 

The US national debt will probably never go away. So why even use it as a debating point or excuse to not do something that will increase it further? In my opinion, it's just slightly delaying the inevitable, which is us being even more in debt. 

I would appreciate a well-educated opinion on this subject. I acknowledge that I don't know much about what I'm talking about, and I'm open to have my mind changed.",2020-05-21 07:34:27,changemyview
"CMV: No, NASA did not just “discover” a “parallel universe” that runs “opposite to our time and physics”, whatever the fuck that means.","Seriously, some of the articles I’ve read on this topic are pretty silly.

Here is what the excitements DID find.

“...High-energy particles can only be detected coming ""down"" from space -- but NASA's experimental ANITA has detected heavier particles. These heavier particles are called tau neutrinos and they are coming ""up"" out of the Earth...”

From this evidence, this final conclusion is made:

“Well, the ""simplest"" explanation is that when the Big Bang happened -- there were two universes that formed. The one we exist in now, and another one that -- from our perspective at least -- is running in reverse. Time goes backwards in that parallel universe, and in that universe -- time in our universe would be going backwards. Has your mind exploded yet?”

Huh? Is that not a liiiiiiiiittle bit of a stretch? Essentially the same paragraph was copy/pasted  to most of the articles I read. 

First off, Peter Gorham, the principal physicist on the project, said

“Not everyone was comfortable with the hypothesis”

Which is a pretty big deal coming from the leader of the institution doing the study. Himself mentions something that my be interpreted as at least a somewhat more “simple” solution.

“the only way it could (the heavy particle traveling through the earth and coming back up through the atmosphere) happen is if the particle changed into a different type of particle before passing through the Earth and then back again.”

Although maybe this is far fetched too, each article mentions this but gives it no attention compared to the far more outlandish claim of a parallel universe. 

Earlier in the article they mention this

“The Earth is bombarded with high-energy particles from space everyday...Low-energy, subatomic neutrinos with a mass close to zero can pass completely through Earth, but higher-energy objects are stopped by the solid matter of our planet""

I understand my amateur and armchair physics are likely wrong, but hear me out. 

The ANITA, the device used to detect these low/high energy particles moving up from the earth. 

I’m not sure why the articles and scientists are assuming the particles are coming from within the earth in the first place. 

Doesn’t it make sense, if these particles are too heavy (or dense, or too large, I don’t necessarily trust the terminology used in the articles, but it’s what I’m using as my basis) to pass through earth...that they wouldn’t? And that they wouldn’t be able to escape earth either? Why is it not assumed that the high energy/heavy particles are *bouncing* off the high-mass surface that they aren’t supposed to be able to pass through. 

The hypothesis that these particles are “moving backward through time” and that explains why we’re catching these heavy particles moving up makes no sense. Why is this the only crossover between our universes? And, is the assumption that our earth and this parallel earth are literally occupying the same space? But not?

I don’t quite get what the direct link is between these heavy particles moving upwards has to do with physics being reversed in this opposite universe. Is the assumption that, because In our universe heavy particles can ONLY *fall* towards the earth, that if particles are moving away from earth are observed, it must be because our laws of physics are being broken? 

I know practically jack shit about the physics of sub-atomic particles, especially the tau particles observed in these studies, but Gorham’s hypothesis mentioned earlier isn’t wrong because heavy particles moving upwards is impossible, but because it would be impossible for particles to change weight/mass/size just to travel through earth and come out the other side  the same size (or whatever) they came into the earth as. 

And, again, if the hypothesis is that particles moving upwards means that there is a parallel universe, why does that mean physics and time are reversed. 

First, one cancels out the other. The observation that enforces this hypothesis is heavy particles moving upwards. 

In our “base” reality, according the this hypothesis, particles of this type only fall towards earth. So, if time is reversed the particles will be moving up, and if you add the opposite physics to that universe, the particles will reverse again to be moving downwards. 

I know this is a vast oversimplification of the impacts of what a reversal of time and physics would be, but that’s kind of the point. 

How is “what should be going down is going up” account for the vast amount of variables that would change in a universe where “time and physics are reversed”? 

This isn’t even to account for the flimsiness of those concepts in the first place. What does a “universe who’s time runs backwards to our own” even mean? Maybe it seems simple, but it’s really not. 

Even in a universe where “time is flipped. Man”, cause and effect doesn’t suddenly become effect and cause. Time can be “quicker” or “slower” relative to itself, but it can’t just 180 relative to itself. Imagine what the life of a human being would be like in a “time moves backwards world”. You would just be consciously dragged backwards through the same actions you’ve done in this universe, there would be no logic and learning would be impossible. That’s not an “opposite” logic to ours, it would just be an additional universal force (like gravity or inertia) pulling objects in its universe this way or that, but it wouldn’t be a force measurable within its own universe or based on its own contents, it would be entirely dependent on the going ons of the base universe.

Why would beings who have equal control of their bodies as us behave like that? Why would we have (at least the illusion of) free will, but they would not, because if their time runs backwards, they would inherently not be able to make choices, meaning they would have no actual control of their bodies, simply being puppetted along based on this universes actions.

Additionally, how can universes be running on opposite times line, but still be parallel? By definition, our universes would only be “parallel” at one single point in time, whatever the theoretical “middle” of time would be. 

The articles and scientists also state how both of our universes were created at the same time by the Big Bang. This is obviously just non-science mumbo-jumbo. How could the other universe be running backwards in time if it had the same birth as ours? Wouldn’t that universe begin with its destruction (or an opposite singularity), and END with the Big Bang?

I could keep going, but this post if long enough as is, and a lot of the issues are mainly extremely poor and irresponsible use of semantics. Almost all of the jargon about “parallel universes” and “time running backwards” is just scientific word salads with no direct connection to eachother besides consisting of other exciting and outrageous claims.

As Ibrahim Safa, Another scientist who worked on the project, said “We’re left with either the most exciting or boring possibilities”.

Yeah, guess which one it probably is.

Article sources: 

https://nypost.com/search/NASA/

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tweaktown.com/news/72645/nasa-scientists-find-evidence-of-parallel-universe-time-runs-backward/amp.html

Amongst many others, these were just the two I pulled direct quotes from. however, most of the others I read were eerily similar to these two (even these two share some very similar phrasing)

(Just to mention, the New York Post’s tab headline, meaning not the headline in the article but the one you’d click on to get to the article from another page on that website, is “NASA detects evidence of a parallel universe that’s probably better than the one we’re in”. I have no idea why the hell they said that, nothing in the article states what life in the universe would be like (although I have here and it would probably suck dick seeing as to how you would be confused your whole life as to the logic of your existence, or the thoughts would be in the same language you think them now, but backwards and you wouldn’t have any will to question it. How in any sense would that be *better* than our lives?) so I’m not sure why they make the weird assumption that a life with reversed physics and time would somehow be better? But it’s not like they touched on it anyways so who even gives a fuck anyways? If you can’t tell, I’m pretty ticked by that weird, nihilistic-quirky phrasing)",2020-05-21 05:45:22,changemyview
CMV: The US and China are two side of the same coin,"To begin with, I am not a member either of these sociopolitical 'superpowers' however, international news is dominated by events directly related to the US and China. It's become increasingly clear to me that these countries are no better than each other and they in fact have more in common than they seem to think.

Both countries foster and intense sense of nationalism in their people that results in extreme patriotism that allows its people to think they're above the rest of the world.
Both countries continually exploit foreign countries and people, commiting pretty horrific acts for their own benefit.  (Dentention centres, prison Labour, drone strikes etc.) Not to mention their nuclear stockpiles.
Both countries are also run by extremely authoritarian governments and when faced by backlash from the global community they both play the victim.


The biggest difference I can see between these countries is the value of the collective vs the individual. 

The US is all about freedom and the 'rugged Individual'! Until that individual isn't a US citizen or is the wrong colour, or holds the wrong beliefs. 
Where as China is all about the people over the individual! Until there's money to be made, or there's a chance to get ahead.

"CMV: Pirating, buying grey/black market keys, or abstaining from activating Windows 10 is both unethical and damaging to the developers of the software","On all PC related subreddits including /r/pcmasterrace /r/buildapc /r/pcgaming /r/windows ETC, the purchasing of Windows 10 software is seen as a waste of money or unnecessary given cheaper/free options.

I recently saw a post in which a user posted a picture of all the hardware boxes for his upcoming build, except this post also had a retail box for windows 10 pro in the frame.

Almost every comment mocked the user for daring to actually buy the Operating System at full retail price or at all.

Other posts I have seen openly suggest either leaving it Unactivated or buying cheap grey/black market keys on Ebay etc.

I have also seen the usual arguments against the quality of the product, these often come from users who advocate for the use of open source software such as Linux. 

My first argument against this culture of disdain for the intrinsic value of the operating system is as follows. PC builders understand the nature of buying at full retail prices all the necessary hardware required to complete a functioning computer, but scoff at what is arguably the most important part of a computer; An OS. 

The operating system is the single part of a computer that you will use the most over its life, you cannot use your computer without initializing Windows unless you feel like sitting in the bios for the life of your computer.

Windows enables all purchased hardware to talk to each-other and work together, users can install software to enjoy video games, often using API's that directly require windows to operate. 

My second argument is that even though people have raised some sensationalized or even legitimate criticisms of the OS, it cannot be denied that thousands and thousands of people at Microsoft spent years of work and blood sweat and tears trying to create an operating system that functions on billions of different and unique hardware configurations. These are good people who need to be paid, the morality test we employ examines what would happen if everyone pirated or refused to activate windows 10, in which case the OS would cease to exist and these people would lose their jobs.

For these reasons I cannot agree with those users who neglect to rationalize the value proposition Microsoft is proposing. $199 or so to have a lifetime license to an operating system that will receive continues updates and will be used every single second the computer is powered on is not unreasonable or overpriced, it is incredibly affordable relative to the value the average end user will receive.

I understand that there are other legitimate options of OS that may be acquired for cheaper/free, I do not want to get into that issue as I have already made a wall of text, for the sake of this post I will assume that Windows is the operating system of choice for all concerned parties.",2020-05-21 02:32:33,changemyview

Australia has had even greater raises in the minimum wage to the US (workers must be paid 11.58 AUD in the US, and here in Australia you must pay the worker 19.49 AUD) which is why you will see at least a remnant of the once great manufacturing industry in the US, while here it has almost completely disappeared.

CMV: The recently dismissed discrimination lawsuit by the U.S. Women's Soccer team and the circus surrounding it is strong evidence of ideological bias in the media.,"In my view it's abundantly clear that the many people in U.S. Women's Soccer and/or the mainstream media either knowingly or complicitly have been intentionally misleading to the public in the interest of a feminist agenda, or they don't understand the details of their own contract.

CNN's article [here](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/us/uswnt-equal-pay-claims-dismissed/index.html) talks about the dismissal of the case.

&gt;The US women's national team's fight for equality suffered a major blow Friday, as a federal judge rejected the players' claims that they were paid less than the men's national team.

You have to read halfway through the article to find out that the claim was rejected because they were being paid **more** than the men's team.

&gt; However, Judge R. Gary Klausner wrote in his decision that members of the USWNT did not prove wage discrimination under the Equal Pay Act because the women's team played more games and **made more money** than the men's team. 

Maybe I'm missing something here, but I'm pretty sure if you make *more money* than the men's team, you're not being discriminated against.

Maybe there's a rebuttal to that. But here's the thing: the U.S. Women's Soccer team knew exactly what they were doing when they chose the contract that they did, and for members of the team who were interviewed about the issue, they were either wildly ignorant of their own contract, or intentionally omitting or obscuring details about the contract in the interest of advancing a feminist agenda.

I will quote [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/gc854x/judge_dismisses_us_womens_national_soccer_teams/fpa3r6c?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), an analogy which is both extremely clear and also succinct (but maybe it's not accurate).

&gt;2 employees are offered the SAME contracts as sales reps for $30k/yr with 35% commission.  
&gt;  
&gt;Employee A accepts. Employee B rejects.  
&gt;  
&gt;Employee B counters asking for $50k/yr and a bunch of other benefits. Company Accepts but with only 15% commission. Both Employee B and Company AGREE to the compromise.  
&gt;  
&gt;A year goes by:  
&gt;  
&gt;Employee A doesn’t do that great and only has $100k in sales so they get $65k (35% commission x $100k sales + their $30k salary).  
&gt;  
&gt;Employee B has a great year and has $400k in sales so they get $110k (15% commission x $400k sales + their $50k salary).  
&gt;  
&gt;Employee B sues company for ‘discrimination’ because if they had Employee A's contract (the one they rejected) they would have made $170k (35% commission x $400k sales + $30k salary)

If I'm not mistaken, this information about the difference between the Women's and Men's soccer teams has been publicly available since the beginning of this story, or close to it.

So then, why did so many mainstream news outlets run with the story of the Women's Soccer team without challenging them on the specifics of their contract deals?

For the news outlets that discussed this story we have a bit of an Epicurean assertion:

* Did they not know this information despite it being publicly known? Then they are (very) incompetent.
* Did they not communicate this information in a direct and empirical manner? Then they are incompetent or biased.
* Did they intentionally hide, omit, or obscure the details of the contracts to advance an ideological agenda? Then they are strongly biased to the point of being corrupt.

I think this is evidence of a strong left-wing/feminist agenda in the media. Normally I wouldn't make such a claim without strong evidence, but I think the details of this case and the ruling the judge laid out is strong evidence that all parties involved with the contract knew exactly why they might have had a ""different"" pay structure than the men's team, not to mention the mildly important fact that they were **literally paid more than the men's team.** If nothing else, this fact should be been front and center in each and every discussion about their discrimination case. Maybe it was, and you can show me evidence that news orgs at least made an honest attempt at communicating this.

The public shouldn't allow news organizations to behave this way. Now that the case has been quietly dismissed, the public will forget all about it and the vast majority of citizens who were filled with righteous feminist anger at the story will likely not learn the outcome of the case and why it was dismissed.

This is a major problem in contemporary American news. They mislead the public in various ways, the truth comes out, it is suppressed or ignored, and the public who were misinformed in the first place are not corrected. The implications in society put forth by dishonest news orgs have permanently made their home in their worldview, only to be corrected when forced to in debate or other similar means.

Am I off base in some way? Maybe this information wasn't publicly known when the story was at the height of its popularity. Maybe the details of the contract were actually known to far fewer people than I assume. Maybe it's plausible that the Women's Soccer team didn't know about the details of their contracts for some reason so they didn't correct the media when they were interviewed in the news.

CMV: The Snyder Cut of Justice League will be just as shit as the theatre cut.,"This guy has already directed two of the biggest films in the DCEU and has already fucked the both of them up. BVS had another cut released and it still fucking blowed.

I do not blame Snyder entirely for what happened to JL, he didn't get to truly see his movie through to the end the way he would have wanted it, so I can understand why going back and doing his cut would make sense. But based off of past movies, theatrical cut or otherwise, I don't have much faith in this version being better.

CMV:The U.S. should provide African Americans repirations,"Overcoming racial tension will not resolve the disparity between whites and blacks caused by the centuries of racist policies. New York University sociologist, Patrick Sharkey analyzed the data surrounding child poverty between the years 1955 to 1970. Only 4% of white children were born into high poverty neighborhoods, but 62% of black children were. A Pew research study found in 2007 that 14% of lower-income white households had a zero or negative net worth, but this number was 32% for black households.10

In 2015, Paul Kiel and Annie Waldman published in ProPublica their investigation into an emerging trend, lawsuits to garnish wages for delinquent debts. “In neighborhoods that had the same income level, the same household income, on average, we were finding twice as many lawsuits in the mostly black neighborhoods.” The first assumption is that these companies are deliberately targeting black communities. This idea is not the case. Paul Kiel notes that these debt collection lawsuits are incredibly impersonal. The process is fairly automated. “You're literally a name on a spreadsheet to these companies.”11 The problem stemmed from generational wealth. An article published in 2014 by the Pew Research Center noted that the average black household has a net worth of $11,000, but the average white household has a net worth of $141,000. During times of financial struggle, it is common to ask family or friends for financial assistance. This American Life reporter, Chana Joffe-Walt, through her analysis of the largest national survey of consumer finance is better able to illuminate the social consequences. “If you ask people, could you borrow $3,000 from a friend or family member in an emergency? White people are much more likely to say yes. Poor whites, a white person living in abject poverty, has roughly the same ability to borrow $3,000 in an emergency as a middle-class black person.” Centuries of oppression and discriminatory policies have limited African American’s wealth both on an individual and social level. The effects are disastrous. 

Ta-Nehisi Coates illustrates the racist history that led to this wealth gap through the story of Clyde Ross. Clyde Ross grew up on his family’s 40-acre farm in the 1920s in Jim Crow Mississippi. His father was accused of owing $3000 in back taxes. Being illiterate, without the support of the local courthouse and the ability to find a lawyer, his father was unable to dispute the claim. His family farm that was “flush[ed] with cows, hogs, and mules” was repossessed, and the family was forced into sharecropping. Illegitimate land seizure was not uncommon. A 2001 investigation by the found 406 victims of land theft since the antebellum period, totaling 24,000 acres.

As Clyde Ross entered adulthood, he was drafted into the U.S. military during World War 2. When his service concluded, like many returning soldiers, he moved to Chicago, seeking stable employment, a family life, and homeownership. The American dream. Buying a home was difficult for African Americans during this time. Homeowner associations would prevent African Americans from buying local properties under protective covenants and when that failed, threats of violence and bombing were utilized. The Federal Housing Association was created in 1934 to encourage homeownership by insuring mortgages in desirable neighborhoods. Ta-Nehisi Coates states: “Neighborhoods where black people lived were rated ‘D’ and were usually considered ineligible for FHA backing.”13 Because of the combined efforts of white homeowners and the FHA, black residents often bought their home through a predatory on contract agreement. The house Clyde Ross lived in was bought 6 months prior for $12,000 before he agreed out of limited options to buy the house on contract for $27,500. The agreement required him to pay a monthly installment. Failing to pay for even one month before the contract was resolved would result in evictions. One estimate argues that up to 85% of African Americans in Chicago bought their homes through predatory on contract purchases.

Even in the last decade, institutions have predatorily targeted black communities. In 2012, Wells Fargo had to pay $175 million in reparations for providing predatory loans to black communities under the guise of fostering new generational wealth.

CMV: We Should Remove the Second Amendment,"This post refers to the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, and will thus be US-centric. 

  
Lots of people will defend the second amendment as necessary to our freedoms. They'll usually cite two important perceived benefits of gun ownership:  


1. Guns can protect the owner from crime.
2. Guns can make it easier to rebel if the government gets corrupted and turns into a dictatorship. 

I'll readily admit that if these two points were true, unrestricted gun access might be worth it - even at the cost of more unnecessary deaths from mass shootings and suicide. The thing is, \*neither claim is true.\*   


As far as protecting gun owners from crime: gun owners are much more likely to be the victims of crime. Areas with large numbers of guns also face very high violent crime rates. Some of that is reverse causation (if you live in a violent neighborhood, you're more likely to buy a gun) but some of it is direct causation. Research shows that if you give someone a gun, a tense situation is much more likely to devolve into shooting. And if we licensed guns more heavily, you wouldn't need one to defend yourself. And buying a gun for safety is almost always a bad move - you're far more likely to die from suicide from your own gun than at the hands of someone else's.   


With regards to rebelling against a corrupt government: we have pretty good data on this, and armed rebellions almost always fail. Nonviolent rebellions - such as general strikes - succeed about half the time. So if you're really scared of totalitarian government here in the US, you should support creating more labor unions, not buying more guns!  


TL;DR guns neither protect the owner nor society, and we would be well served to heavily limit access to them.",2020-05-20 21:40:35,changemyview
CMV: It's harder to be nice online than it is in person,"In person you can smile, give body language, and at least fake civility and common respect. 

Online you are, for the most part, *not* accountable for your actions. 

Being nice almost always implies selfless *acts* or *going out of your way* to improve someone else's experience around you. Online and in person. 

Therefore you will follow the path of least resistance and resort to hostility and aggression than tolerance and generosity when directly interacting with other people online. 

Which inevitably results in a self fulfilling cycle of negativity and aggression to people online, as even when our identity is a secret,  our ego is still fully intact and completely defensive. 

In a lot of cases (probably) many people use online interactions as an outlet for aggression and negativity as they have no other way to release these emotions.

Generally speaking... i do understand random acts of kindness do occur online but absolutely no one loads into a game of COD and says ""people will be okay that I'm not good at this game in the chat lobby"", as an example. Hence why it's called random,  as it's not the norm even if it does occur.

CMV: I see no compelling argument in favour of the death penalty in the United States,"There are several common arguments used to support the death penalty. 

1. It is more cost effective 

2. It reduces the burden on the criminal justice system 

3. It serves as a deterrent to crime 

4. It fulfills society's basic need for retribution. 


Starting with the cost effectiveness, the argument is that it would cost more to incarcerate someone for life than it would to just kill them. This is based off comparing the amount of money needed to clothe, feed and house these inmates. But this is somewhat misleading. 

Killing somebody requires more than just some chemicals or some rope. The judicial process between initial conviction/sentencing and execution is often extremely long. The death row inmate usually puts the state through a very lengthy appeals process. This takes time (where we would have to feed and house the inmate anyway) and costs taxpayers money in the sense that we are effectively paying the government to put these appeals to bed. 

When you include the cost of the appeals process and the subsequent cost of paying these lawyers and judges to go through it, the Death Penalty often ends up being the more expensive option. 

The aforementioned appeals process also puts an extra burden on the criminal justice system. Whereas before we would just sentence and jail these inmates, the system now has to use resources to go through the motions of appeals. 

Now it would stand to reason that the death penalty would serve as a deterrent to capital offenses, but the numbers generally don't corroborate this. In the states, the likelihood of a violent and capital offense occurring in a state with the death penalty is generally as high if not higher than in a state without the death penalty. 

And when you think about it, it stands to reason. Most capital offenses involve murder. They are generally done either out of passion (in which case all the deterrence in the world could not stop it) or it was premeditated. Generally people who commit premeditated murder 

1. Are already aware of the high costs related to being caught 

2. Sure that they won't be caught or are indifferent to the possibility. 

You can slap death in their face and it will be just as meaningless as any other deterrent because they just don't care. *Who cares if you'll kill me if I get caught: I won't get caught* is often the prevailing reasoning of criminals. 

The last point about us and retribution speaks towards the baseness of the American culture. We are not alone in our desire to see bad guys punished. It is a human feeling. But the fact that we are nearly alone in the Western World regarding our desire to see people killed by the government should indicate that perhaps this is not a feature necessary for a healthy and fair justice system.",2020-05-20 20:53:28,changemyview
CMV: All Lives Matter is a completely valid stance to take and is not anti-Black Lives Matter," 

Let me begin by clarifying two points, firstly I am not opposed to a lot of the work BLM does and feel it's intentions are clearly very good, however, I take issue with the narrative that police shootings are a purely racial issue. Secondly, I do not deny racial profiling is clearly a factor in police shootings, and racism is obviously still very much alive and active in both individuals and the government.

All Lives Matter has become a big taboo in the world of progressives and social rights activists, often cited as being a form of counterprotest against BLM. Yes, some people do actively use the term with bigoted agendas in mind, but if you actually took a moment to listen to some of them you would realize for many this is not the intent. However, it seems not a week goes by where I don't see at least one ""of course all lives matter, but we are focusing on the black ones right now."" post, I've even seen analogies involving pizza places, however, they all break down to one point: ALM is ridiculous, because unarmed police shootings are a race issue and white people do not have race issues and therefore do not have to deal with misuse of a police force. You see comments that push exactly this narrative all over the internet, ""if he was black he would have been shot, etc."" Here's the issue, by looking at statistics surrounding shootings, it becomes clear police violence is an issue that affects everyone, albeit some are affected more than others, meaning the overall problem is a lack of police accountability and training, and racial discrimination is just a factor in the overall issue. Let me put it this way: if suddenly everyone was colorblind to race, unarmed black men would statistically still be shot, just at a lower rate than today.

Now, of course, you will want to see some cold hard evidence, so here are some numbers from what is likely the most complete police shooting database [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/) :

In 2019, 41 unarmed US citizens were shot by police, of those 9 were black, 19 were white, 6 were Hispanic, and 7 were of other races. Many people are surprised by this as we don't often hear about shootings of white people or Hispanics on the news, why? Because it doesn't sell. Maybe we get a glimpse if there is high-quality footage and it was really really unjustified, but even then many white shootings don't make it past the local papers.

Overall there needs to be huge reforms in police training that step outside of simply reducing racial biased. It should not be taboo to talk about the other victims of police shootings and it is certainly not anti-BLM to do so. This misidentification of the overall issue and the shaming involved when bringing up the fact other races are also affected creates a really anti-progressive culture that accomplishes very little in the grand scheme of things.

Tl-dr: Police shootings affect every one of every race, it should not be looked down upon to focus on police brutality as a whole instead of just the racial factor of it.",2020-05-20 20:46:53,changemyview
CMV: collective punishment in schools is wrong and not effective.,"""Collective punishment"" = when only one  student (or a few students) is misbehaving or does somehting bad and the teacher punishes the entire class, including the students that were on their best behavior.

For example: Billy and Bobby are being very disruptive in class (yelling, laughing too loudly, and not paying attention to the lesson). All the other students are on their best behavior. The teacher tells the 2 boys several times to stop. They do not. So the teacher announces that the whole class is not going out for recess.

Another example; there are 20 students in the class. 16 of them didn't bother to do their homework last night. So as punishment the teacher cancels the movie that she planned to allow the class to watch today, so the 4 students that did do their homework receive that punishment too.

My view is that this kind of punishment is not right. 

First and foremost, it needlessly punishes the well behaved students for the wrong actions of others, and that's not fair.

The other reason for my view is that punishing only the misbehaving students is much more effective. For example; if only two students are misbehabing, only those two should be made to stay inside for recess. When those two students see their peers had fun outside without them, the two students will think about what they did and not do it again.

DISCLAIMER: I am not saying the majority of teachers do this. Plenty don't, but there is a few that do (I had one teacher in elementary school who loved this form of discipline) and this form of punishment shouldn't be used in anyone's classroom.",2020-05-20 20:23:34,changemyview

CMV: The college system and the role degrees play in hiring in the US is fucked up,"So in the United States college has come to [cost](https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college/) an absurd amount, commonly about the cost of outright [buying a house](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/29/what-the-median-home-price-of-200000-will-get-you-across-the-us.html) \- all spent within a 4-5 year period of a young adult's life. Since obviously most people don't have that kind of money just lying around kids are deciding at 18 to take out loans that will on average take them [longer than they've even been alive](https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/10/07/student-loan-expectations-myth-vs-reality) at the point they make these decisions to repay. 

And what do you get for your tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars? Well colleges are a business. Assuming you preform you get sold a scrap of paper that theoretically means you know some stuff about certain subjects. Of course only a [minority](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/08/02/new-data-track-graduates-six-popular-majors-through-their-first-three-jobs) of people actually end up ""using"" their degree in the sense that they work in a field related to their major. And it's almost a stereotype that people say they never use the stuff they learned in college or that they learned more about their major in the first month on the job than they did in four years studying it or whatever. 

So what are you *really* buying from college? Well for many majors and many jobs, essentially what you're buying is something you can put on your resume to increase the chance of employers not just throwing your resume out after a first glance. Which is absurd. I suppose you could argue that what hiring managers are really looking for is evidence that the candidate can meet deadlines or commit to something or whatever, but there's no reason at all that should cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and half a decade to prove. I mean hell someone just *working* and actually *making* money in that same timeframe would prove those things just as well, and unless the career is in academia it will essentially guarantee that the experience gained is more relevant to the workforce than the experience you'd gain at college. 

All in all college should cost less and our culture should be more accepting of people without degrees. I find it fairly inexcusable that many jobs in X field would outright refuse to hire someone who spent 10 years *actually working* in X field but would happily hire someone who spent a portion of 2 years in college learning some stuff about X field. There are some exceptions (for example I still think doctors should be required to have the degrees they do in order to be doctors - although they should also have easier access to affordable schooling) but by and large the US would benefit from having a work culture less obsessed with expectations of college degrees that often have nothing to do with the field being hired for. 

I mean any system that says ""hey 18 year old kids, you have to blow $200,000 and go into debt for two decades to get a piece of paper saying you know some stuff about history otherwise all the businesses you could work at that have nothing to do with history will never hire you and you'll have a lower quality of life forever"" seems like a pretty fucked up system.

CMV: I think men should have a say in whether his child is aborted or not.,"Just to clarify, if the man raped the woman/girl he should have 0 say in anything, but if the sex was consensual I think he should get a say in whether his child lives or dies because that is still his child too. 

The idea of ""no uterus no say"" has never made sense to me because once again, that's his kid that he helped make and if he wants to take care of the baby after he/she is born I think he should get that chance. People have also said that the woman shouldn't be forced to carry the baby for 9 months and my response to that is 1) If you're big enough to have sex you're big enough to deal with the consequences, 2) 9 months is nothing compared to all the years you will be taking away from the man.

Another reason I think ""no uterus no say/her body her choice"" is damaging to men is because it takes away their responsibility to the child they helped create. The man could then argue that if it's ""her body her choice"" then it's also ""her problem"" and as it's ""his body his choice"" he doesn't have to help provide for his baby.

The only situation in which I would agree with abortion is if you're in a situation in  which both the mother and the baby will die otherwise. In this case or if the pregnant woman was raped, then I think the man should have no say.",2020-05-20 18:39:42,changemyview
CMV: Free Will does not exist [Long],"The TL;DR is at the bottom for those who do not have all day. 

Before I begin, I should define free will. Many people make the mistake of assuming free will is the ability to do what one desires, however I would say this is faulty as this MAY be true, but even if so, one cannot control what they desire, so this would not constitute “free”. I define it as the ability for a situation to have a potential to go more than one way in the context of human examples. I would argue that when someone makes a decision, it is literally impossible for them to have made any other decision. As you can tell, this is the view known as determinism, saying that everything is predetermined, including human consciousness. 

Now, there are many reasons I believe this way, but I’ll narrow them down to three groups.

The Philosophical/Straight Reason Proofs

These two are not really proofs as they do not contain any actual science, but they are the most reasonable and most likely to convince people that they are not free as the science behind the next couple of proofs is pretty insane, and most people, including myself, have a difficult time understanding it. In fact, it is this argument that, when it came into my head, was the one that totally convinced me. Sam Harris is also partially responsible for convincing me that free will is an illusion as he had a hand in one of these arguments. Anyways, let’s get started. 

So, first I have to beg the question: what do we act on? Well, we act on intuition (which we don’t control) and thoughts that come into our heads (which we also don’t control). 

Think of a city. Any city. Now, before you do, realize that this is as free of a decision that you’ll ever make. You have all the cities in the world, thousands of them, to choose from, and no restrictions. Not one makes logical sense over the other. So, now that you’ve thought of your city, I’m going to show you why you didn’t make that decision. First off, there are thousands of options that were completely out the window because they didn’t occur to you. Now, why didn’t they occur to you? Not because of your own choosing, but because of something else choosing what occurs to you or not.  Even when you narrow it down to just three, it’s still not you, because there was something in you that wanted to pick one of them. There wasn’t really a debate, and even if there was, all of the information brought up in that “debate” came from your subconscious. Why? Simply because it did. You cannot control your subconscious, and you therefore cannot control what you think about, and we all know that what you think controls what you do. 

We can apply this to everyday life as well. Let’s think of a simple decision, another one that would appear to the naked eye to be free. What ice cream to get. Let’s say I walk into an ice cream shop and look at both Chocolate and Vanilla. I’m going to get what I want, which, in my case, is vanilla. But why do I want it? Because of my nature. My brain is predetermined to already want vanilla ice cream before this moment. But, some might argue, I have the choice to simply go against my wants because I want to prove you wrong. Not so fast. If you want to prove me wrong, that was also predetermined. Just like you can’t control what ice cream you want, you can’t control any of your other desires. Think of any action, and it could be traced back to something in your mind that you can’t control. Every action in life is done for one of two reasons: 
You want to do it
You are forced to do it
It is extremely obvious that acting because of someone else’s force is not free, and we’ve already covered that doing what you want is also not free because you can’t come close to controlling what you want. There has to be something in you that controls every action. 

Neuroscientific Proof 

This one is a lot more concrete. In 1964, two German scientists monitored the electrical activity of a dozen people’s brains. Each day for several months, volunteers came into the scientists’ lab at the University of Freiburg to get wires fixed to their scalp from a showerhead-like contraption overhead. The participants sat in a chair, tucked neatly in a metal tollbooth, with only one task: to flex a finger on their right hand at whatever irregular intervals pleased them, over and over, up to 500 times a visit. The purpose of this experiment was to search for signals in the participants’ brains that preceded each finger tap. At the time, researchers knew how to measure brain activity that occurred in response to events out in the world—when a person hears a song, for instance, or looks at a photograph—but no one had figured out how to isolate the signs of someone’s brain actually initiating an action. The experiment’s results came in squiggly, dotted lines, a representation of changing brain waves. In the milliseconds leading up to the finger taps, the lines showed an almost undetectably faint uptick: a wave that rose for about a second, like a drumroll of firing neurons, then ended in an abrupt crash. This flurry of neuronal activity, which the scientists called the Bereitschaftspotential, or readiness potential, was like a gift of infinitesimal time travel. For the first time, they could see the brain readying itself to create a voluntary movement. This momentous discovery was the beginning of a lot of trouble in neuroscience. Twenty years later, the American physiologist Benjamin Libet used the Bereitschaftspotential to make the case not only that the brain shows signs of a decision before a person acts, but that, incredibly, the brain’s wheels start turning before the person even consciously intends to do something. Suddenly, people’s choices—even a basic finger tap—appeared to be determined by something outside of their own perceived volition. 

More recent studies confirm this idea. 

“In a classic paper published almost 20 years ago, the psychologists Dan Wegner and Thalia Wheatley made a revolutionary proposal: The experience of intentionally willing an action, they suggested, is often nothing more than a post hoc causal inference that our thoughts caused some behavior. The feeling itself, however, plays no causal role in producing that behavior. This could sometimes lead us to think we made a choice when we actually didn’t or think we made a different choice than we actually did. But there’s a mystery here. Suppose, as Wegner and Wheatley propose, that we observe ourselves (unconsciously) perform some action, like picking out a box of cereal in the grocery store, and then only afterwards come to infer that we did this intentionally. If this is the true sequence of events, how could we be deceived into believing that we had intentionally made our choice before the consequences of this action were observed? This explanation for how we think of our agency would seem to require supernatural backwards causation, with our experience of conscious will being both a product and an apparent cause of behavior. In a study just published in Psychological Science, Paul Bloom and I explore a radical—but non-magical—solution to this puzzle. Perhaps in the very moments that we experience a choice, our minds are rewriting history, fooling us into thinking that this choice—that was actually completed after its consequences were subconsciously perceived—was a choice that we had made all along.
Though the precise way in which the mind could do this is still not fully understood, similar phenomena have been documented elsewhere. For example, we see the apparent motion of a dot before seeing that dot reach its destination, and we feel phantom touches moving up our arm before feeling an actual touch further up our arm. “Postdictive” illusions of this sort are typically explained by noting that there’s a delay in the time it takes information out in the world to reach conscious awareness: Because it lags slightly behind reality, consciousness can “anticipate” future events that haven’t yet entered awareness, but have been encoded subconsciously, allowing for an illusion in which the experienced future alters the experienced past.
In one of our studies, participants were repeatedly presented with five white circles in random locations on a computer monitor and were asked to quickly choose one of the circles in their head before one lit up red. If a circle turned red so fast that they didn’t feel like they were able to complete their choice, participants could indicate that they ran out of time. Otherwise, they indicated whether they had chosen the red circle (before it turned red) or had chosen a different circle. We explored how likely people were to report a successful prediction among these instances in which they believed that they had time to make a choice. Unbeknownst to participants, the circle that lit up red on each trial of the experiment was selected completely randomly by our computer script. Hence, if participants were truly completing their choices when they claimed to be completing them—before one of the circles turned red—they should have chosen the red circle on approximately 1 in 5 trials. Yet participants’ reported performance deviated unrealistically far from this 20% probability, exceeding 30% when a circle turned red especially quickly. This pattern of responding suggests that participants’ minds had sometimes swapped the order of events in conscious awareness, creating an illusion that a choice had preceded the color change when, in fact, it was biased by it.
Importantly, participants’ reported choice of the red circle dropped down near 20% when the delay for a circle to turn red was long enough that the subconscious mind could no longer play this trick in consciousness and get wind of the color change before a conscious choice was completed. This result ensured that participants weren’t simply trying to deceive us (or themselves) about their prediction abilities or just liked reporting that they were correct. A more speculative possibility is that our minds are designed to distort our perception of choice and that this distortion is an important feature (not simply a bug) of our cognitive machinery. For example, if the experience of choice is a kind of causal inference, as Wegner and Wheatley suggest, then swapping the order of choice and action in conscious awareness may aid in the understanding that we are physical beings who can produce effects out in the world. More broadly, this illusion may be central to developing a belief in free will and, in turn, motivating punishment.
Yet, whether or not there are advantages to believing we’re more in control of our lives than we actually are, it’s clear that the illusion can go too far. While a quarter-of-a-second distortion in time experience may be no big deal, distortions at longer delays—which might plague people with mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder—could substantially and harmfully warp people’s fundamental views about the world. People with such illnesses may begin to believe that they can control the weather or that they have an uncanny ability to predict other people’s behavior. In extreme cases, they may even conclude that they have god-like powers.

In extreme cases, they may even conclude that they have god-like powers.
It remains to be seen just how much the postdictive illusion of choice that we observe in our experiments connects to these weightier aspects of daily life and mental illness. The illusion may only apply to a small set of our choices that are made quickly and without too much thought. Or it may be pervasive and ubiquitous—governing all aspects of our behavior, from our most minute to our most important decisions. Most likely, the truth lies somewhere in between these extremes. Whatever the case may be, our studies add to a growing body of work suggesting that even our most seemingly ironclad beliefs about our own agency and conscious experience can be dead wrong.”

The most important part of this paper is the end, establishing that it is essentially obvious to neuroscientists that the process of “choice” comes after the choice itself. This paper simply fills the gaps by showing that the brain does indeed have this ability, further confirming our understanding of the brain. 

Physics Proof 

This one is by far the weirdest. What follows is a proof by CosmosMagazine of the worldview known as Fatalism, or the idea that absolutely everything is predetermined and one day we’ll be able to see the universe entirely. 

“If we take a continuous function, like a straight line – y = a * x + b – where a and b are fixed parameters and x can assume arbitrary values, we know that for arbitrarily, infinitesimally close values of x, we will still be able to compute the respective values of y without confusion. The trajectory of an apple falling from a tree can be modelled by a continuous straight line that approximates an otherwise fractal curve. Fractals curves are recursive functions that require an initial state. Fractal curves require a continuous world to evolve, especially if we know that the initial condition must be an irrational number. From this, we can deduce that the behaviour of physical objects seem to be ultimately dictated by continuous functions somehow perceived by humans through a grid of these “pixels”. It is self-evident that we always need to divide such things into discrete sections, anyway. If we believe in the Big Bang Theory – and the universe’s continuous expansion is a strong indication that such theory must be correct – the initial state of the universe was a single point (known as a singularity) that then expanded to the cosmos we know and perceive today, which, of course, includes us. If so, there is a causal relationship between the Big Bang and us. In other words, free will is not allowed, and all of our actions are just a mere consequence of that first event. Such a view is known as “determinism”, or “super-determinism” (if one finds it productive to reinvent the wheel). If we believe the initial state of the universe to be quantified by a rational number, we are inferring that it is periodic, non-chaotic and globally predictable in nature. But if the initial state is rather quantified by an irrational number, we are instead inferring that the universe is aperiodic, chaotic and therefore only locally predictable in nature. Today, we know that the universe is chaotic. From such a view, one can be tempted to interject that if free will does not exist, why do we punish criminals? It is not their fault, after all. A counter-argument to that is that punishment is the natural response to crime, such that global equilibrium can be sustained, and therefore punishment is just as unavoidable as the commission of wrongdoing. Because the cosmos is clearly chaotic, we can observe time-reversibility only locally, rather than globally. This in turn means that free will is an inevitable illusion for us humans, due to our subjective perception of the universe, rather than its innermost nature.” 

On more of a down to Earth level, think of it this way: I’m sure everyone would concede that simple actions of nature such as the path of an asteroid in the universe is predetermined and we could find out where its going and when. We can scale this up to more complex things and it’s still true. If we knew enough about physics, we could determine the path of every molecule in a certain area, no matter how complex. So why is the human brain any exception? If we knew enough about physics, surely we could map out all of the molecules in our brain and where they’re going and when. 

TL;DR
Free will does not exist because 
1. We cannot control our subconscious
2. Our brain has been observed to make decisions in the subconscious seconds before the conscious process of making a decision occurs
3. The universe can be mapped out through a series of equations assuming all knowledge of the laws of physics and the human brain is no different.",2020-05-20 18:21:06,changemyview

\- You miss out on making memories that you cannot replace when you go to Community College first

\- Four year colleges give you the opportunity to network and build long lasting bonds and connections, personally and professionally. You cannot do that with Community College to the same degree

\- You will likely miss out on things like Greek life and Study Abroad if you go to Community College

Of course, there's many exceptions, such as feel-good subs and meme subs etc., but them majority of redditors (not subreddits) are here to try and sound smart in front of a bunch of strangers they'll likely never see in real life. It's common knowledge that the left is occupied by more younger people than the right, (since young people are more prone to making risky decisions and don't have too much life experience), which explains why almost all social media sites are Leftist-dominated. Or so it seems. I do feel like there's nearly a relatively equal number of rightists and leftists on this site, but it's also common knowledge that leftists (usually) are MUCH louder and more in-your-face than rightists, which could be manipulating as to what percent of Redditors are actually leftist.

"CMV: We are in a simulation, when we die we will be in another simulation","Essentially, with the advancement of computers and simulations getting better each year, there will come a time where we make simulations so real and life like, that they essentially start the cycle of life again as a simulation, and within that it will get so advanced that there will be a simulation within a simulation advanced to mimic 'real life' etc to the power of infinate. 

Now I would consider mostly to be an athiest, but right now my belief is being fixed on the idea that we are in a simulation. When we die we will just be in another simulation, and on and on for infinite time and infinite simulations. I guess you could call this reincarnation in a way. 

I in no means think that what we do in this life is pointless, in fact as what I am feeling now is very real which therefore drives me to succeed at what i'm doing. I'm sure many will argue why does it matter, its just another argument for a theist, vs atheist.

Just a thought I've been stuck on, and no matter what, from an atheist stand point it still fits. Everything is random, the simulation is random, there is no higher power. Just technology forever, with infinite power creating infinite power creating infinite power which recreates life. Forever.

CMV: Stopping the derogatory use of the n-word requires corroboration from those that use it non-derogatorily,"In Mean Girls, Tina Fey says, ""You all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores. It only makes it okay for guys to call you sluts and whores."" The girls at the high school all realize that, yeah, she's right. By calling each other these words (whether cruelly or like ""yas slut""), we're only increasing their prevalence which, in turn, decreases the stigma around the word.

Why is it unreasonable for me to think that those that use the word in an alleviated way (like rappers) could help stop the derogatory use of the n-word?

Think about that girl who got absolutely destroyed at that Kendrick Lamar concert for singing the n-word in a lyric after she had been brought up onstage. Her intention was in no way demeaning. She was simply just trying to sing along with a guy who pulled her onstage to sing along. She did it because she thought she was being welcomed to do it. (For the record, I do think the girl is a moron for doing it a second time) 

Imitation is a form of flattery. When we look up to people, we tend to copy their behavior. 

I'm in no way trying to equate slut/whore with the n-word. One is obviously worse and far more derogatory than the other, so please do not think that this is the comparison I'm trying to make.

Of course, those that do use the n-word in an intended derogatory way are shitty. And a far bigger problem than the girl at the concert, for example. This is not my point either. But when we talk about cutting down the use of this word, why is it never even a suggestion that its use is limited by those that use it non-derogatorily?

The way I see it, bringing a gun like that to a protest elevates the protest from ""I feel strongly about this issue"" to ""I feel strongly about this issue and am ready and willing to kill someone if I don't get my way."" It's an implicit threat of violence.

If the police show up to a protest like that and tell them that they have to leave, what happens? One of two things:

1. They use the guns they brought along to threaten violence toward the police, or even start shooting in order not to be removed. That's obviously not peaceful.
2. They allow themselves to be peacefully removed without using the guns, in which case why bring them?

The *only* reason to bring a weapon and tactical gear like that to a supposedly ""peaceful"" protest is to tell people, ""you should take me more seriously because I am capable of deadly force,"" which is an intrinsically threatening and *not* peaceable form of protest.",2020-05-20 15:30:57,changemyview
CMV: Incest is only truly stigmatized due to the biological repercussions it sows.,"This isn’t a weirdly sexual point of view, I stg. I have no family related /fetishes/ whatsoever. I find it worth noting that my perspective may be warped as I have had crushes on family members in the past (due to a neglectful homelife, which left me almost completely isolated asides from family such as cousins, who I only saw once a year max. I never viewed them as family members.) 

For hundreds of years, marrying someone in the family was seen as acceptable because of lineage, only to find out it produced complications in children. Those complicates are the sole reason incest is deemed horrible in society.

People marry childhood friends all the time, and it’s romanticized— people who were raised such as siblings. Plus, it is an actual psychological/biological phenomena that you’re generally sexually attracted to a close related family member if you haven’t grown up around them and are then reunited, called Genetic Sexual Attraction. 

I think you fall in love with people in similar situations as you. People who understand. Your family understands problems at home better than anyone, and honestly if you don’t plan on having kids, what’s so wrong with that? or if you can’t have kids?

I’ll admit, most of my line of thinking has been formed based on the case studies of siblings who met back up, having no idea they were related, and fell in love— only to find out later down the road that they shared one or more parent. This topic of conversation has been brought up in my own relationship, and my significant other thinks it is Fucked Up, capital F and U.

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator,"I feel like every time I talk to a conservative they always tell me about their God Ben Shapiro. How he's the most intelligent person you've ever seen. How he's able to destroy snowflakes with the flick of his wrist. How he's the most talented debater in the world.

First off, every video of him destroying him is basically the same. A dumb 18-year old kid that's way too cocky and way underprepared asks a question and he gives a non-answer. Then, the kid maybe gets one chance to respond, but Ben always gets the final word and the mentally-handicapped edge lords in the crowd cheer for him even though the point he made was literally a non-answer. This isn't debate skill, this is setting up a debate in a way that you can't lose. I really want him to debate somebody who knows what they're talking about. A good example of a more fair debate is him vs. Cenk Uygur. While I think Ben won the argument Cenk made a lot of good points and Ben was very quick to use shitty debate tactics which I'll explain in the next paragraph.

Secondly, he always defends his points with some incredibly disingenuous tactic. His common debate tactics include: begging the question, appeal to nature, appeal to tradition, and appeal to authority. The best example of this is him saying ""science is the reason life begins at conception"" without actually defending this point with actual scientific evidence. What he's really saying here is ""Science says that a sperm and an egg cell turn into a fetus at conception. I think this is when life begins based on personal beliefs that have nothing to do with science."" This is a much different argument and is literally the textbook definition of begging the question. But of course nobody calls him out on this because he only debates college freshmen who have no idea what they're doing.

The funny part is I used to like this guy. I thought he was intelligent and well-spoken. I think this is the general trap that the Ben Shapiro supporter falls into. They automatically assume that because he's confident and speaks competently and quickly that what he's saying is true. However, when you take the time to actually look at the way he argues it's incredibly bad-faith and very transparent.

Not only that, humans are omnivores. Therefore we need both plant based foods and meat based ones. The problem with meat isn't that it's unhealthy; it's the fact that people often over-consume it. Too much of anything is unhealthy. If we eliminate meat and dairy from our diets entirely, we will grow weak and sickly. I personally take iron supplements and even though I eat meat every day, my iron levels do not rise. If I were not to eat meat, I would be extremely anemic (I already am.) And no, I am not fat. In fact, I am 49 kilograms as of now, which is underweight for me. 

Although supplements exist to replace some of the nutrients, they cannot work as complete replacements. I have a friend whom is vegan and I've noticed him growing weaker even though he take the supplements and has a healthy diet. 

I am open to discuss this and to change my opinion.",2020-05-20 14:36:40,changemyview
CMV: It is not selfish to NOT donate your organs after death.,"Ok so since today (20th May 2020) in England, everyone is now automatically signed up for organ donation. I will however be opting out of this.

My reason for wanting to opt out is not out of selfishness, but rather the unknown after death. I understand that the chance in needing organs after death is almost impossible. However NO ONE knows what happens after death. Therefore I do not want to risk donating my organs and it turning out that I need them in the afterlife.

Yes, I understand this might sound crazy... but I would rather take zero risk than donate my organs and it turning out it actually matters in the afterlife.

I’ll be interested in seeing why you think this is a selfish act, as I feel that with afterlife being possibly eternal it’s not worth the risk.",2020-05-20 14:21:21,changemyview
"CMV: There's no such a thing as ""Blackface"" or even ""Social Appropriation"".","Before I start, I would like to say that I AM black, just to clarify things.

I do not believe in ""blackface"" and I do not believe in social appropriation either. To me, these are just some of those terms the internet created that never existed before in order to produce massive acceptance and recruit followers of the concept so as to be able to construct a movement around it, or just impose your points in discussions.

I, as a black woman, do not feel the least uncomfortable or even offended when I see a white person wearing box braids, afro hairstyles, and any other fashion choice that is considered ""black"". First, because it doesn't make me feel less than I am. White women can be beautiful in dreadlocks and so can I, I just don't see the issue there. White people can wear makeup that makes them look dark and look beautiful, as I've lost count of how many of my friends have tried to bleach their skin with cleaning supplies as kids because they wanted to look white. Can you spot the hypocrisy? Are we really trying to defend our culture or are we just insecure that the white woman will look better than us with our own styles? Second, because I don't believe in paying evil with evil. So I've seen some people bring the argument that black people have been oppressed by white people because of the way they look. Jobs have been denied, college applications, things like that. And that is absolutely true, I am not denying it. But what are we going to do about that, the same thing? Try to tell them what they can and can't wear/use because it belongs to us? That just doesn't make sense for me. People should be free to wear whatever they want. If the white man denies you a job because you have braids, look for a more acceptant boss. If society ""made"" you straighten your hair because you grew up being told you were not beautiful, guess what, it's 2020, and now we are trending. Telling white people they cannot have what you have now won't give you the afro back or the money you spent or the time you lost because of it. It is just pettiness, there's no protection of culture here.",2020-05-20 14:15:40,changemyview

"CMV: either all drugs (that don’t outright kill people) should be legal, or none at all.","Honestly, this one is pretty simple.  I am more on the side of making them all legal.

1. All drugs are dangerous in some way.  Either to your own health or to others (second hand smoke, drunk driving, etc.).  Also, cherry picking which ones you’ll allow and which you won’t is just silly. (Alcohol is a very dangerous substance, but it’s perfectly legal)

2. Most prescriptions (namely pain killers) are just minor variations of previous banned drugs.

3. A lot of issues (gang violence, OD’s, bad/dangerous quality, meth lab explosions, etc.) would be mitigated or outright eliminated if the process was legitimized.

4. As far as businesses and government are concerned, there’s tons of money to be made.  Which is also nice for the economy.

5. Some portion of the population is always going to want to alter there state of mind no matter what, so drugs are always going to be pursued.

6. Educating the population would probably have a better effect on drug abuse than people think. (Very different then DARE telling people to just abstain!  I mean actually teaching people what they are, what they do, and the associated risks)

7. Give people the freedom of choice.  Bonus points if you help them make an educated choice.  More freedom is always good vs. less.

That should be enough points for you guys to dig into.

"CMV: As a man, if you make less than than 20 dollars an hour, no woman will seriously date you long term.","You can treat someone as well as you want, love them, respect them, be supportive of them, treat her how they deserve. But at the end of the day, as a man, you need to be financially independent and be capable of providing. Now, I am aware that women are earning more these days and that they dont need men to provide. But this does not change the societal consensus that men have to be able to provide for himself as well as her and eventually if you dont make enough $  the woman you're dating will lose respect for you and replace you. Especially if she is a high earner herself. Love is great and everything, but at the end of the day, as a man, you will be judged by what you can provide, not by who you are as a person.",2020-05-20 09:44:48,changemyview
CMV: Children should be taught to be more generous and sharing with their friends in order to counteract the inherent “social selfishness” which is part of human psychology.,"Bit of a mouthful but basically we as humans are selfish in many ways, but one of the way is something that is never addressed and I think contributes massively to “happiness inequality” in our world (and other forms of inequality to like income inequality).

As humans, we are “socially selfish” and in that I mean that we tend to treat those people better who have traits which will benefit us. But, often these people’s lives are already good which is why we want to be a part of it. This means that on the opposite side, we don’t treat people as well whose lives are bad, because they don’t have as much to offer us, but this means that it is harder for people who have had unfortunate circumstances in the lives to get out of it, while those who have been fortunate will continue to to be so.

For example, we treat people better who are funnier and more confident because they make us feel better, but also (I believe) we are wired to because these people are more likely to have successful lives and that is an advantage to us in return (they are funnier because they are happier, which implies their lives are good). There is also a social proof affect that we benefit from to by being their friend; if they are popular then we may raise our social status by being friends with them (even if they are popular only because everyone else want to get some benefit from them in their lives too). Another example is people who are good looking.

A lot of this is subconscious by the way, often we don’t know why we want to be friends with them other than we just “like” them.

Here, I say “treat better” to mean that we do a range of behaviours which benefit these people because we want to be friends with them, such as we invite these people to more things, talk to them more, are more generous with them, respect them them more, laugh at their jokes more etc.

This better treatment by others obviously makes them even more happy and more confident. It also means that they are more likely to get jobs (they come a cross better in interviews) and have more opportunities in life (larger network) and ultimately more likely to be wealthier. And the more popular and confident and successful they get, the more other people want to a part of that which makes it even easier to get even more of this. (They were always more likely because of these traits like confidence, humour and good looks, but the social affects mean that this keeps increasing).

So this leads to an exponential kind of effect, as I said above, whereby we are making it easier for happy people to get even happier, and harder to unhappy people to get happier. Ethically it should be the other way around. 

Now, you may think that’s fair enough. Everyone does it, including me and you and because we do it we emotionally justify it. We even justify it by saying things such as “well Bob is always quiet and never makes any effort so its fair enough I don’t make effort with him, whereas Sam is always making joking and making effort with people.”

But the problem is, Sam isn’t funny and confident because he wants to make other feel better. He’s funny because from a young age he was socially lucky (had funny parents, was raised in a sociable family where he developed good social skills) and developed this skill, and now likes to make people laugh because it gives him a dopamine release when they do (and raises or maintains his higher social status). And his confidence is a byproduct of a lucky upbringing/genetics too.

Conversely, Bob was not lucky socially (unsociable family, delayed social skills), and never developed this skill of being funny and his life didn’t go well enough in many possible ways in order for him to be confident. If social skills are delayed in children then they will end up with less opportunities to socialise because of this very effect I am talking about which will further delay them and widen this gap between socially successful children and socially unsuccessful ones(other children will make less effort with him, he will make friends with other children with poor social skills etc so his social skills would improve at a slower rate then the child with already good social skills). 

But Bob is the one who needs people to treat him well much more than Sam in order to live a happy life. He is the one with poorer social skills who is less happy and so needs more help to improve.

Of course we are selfish in lots of other aspects of life that affects others negatively, but this aspect of selfishness is one which people have not really talked about as contributing to “happiness inequality”, and which they may even not view as selfishness at all. But I think it is a huge factor of why some people have happy lives and others have miserable ones.

Wouldn’t it because great if we put more effort into teaching children to make more effort with those children who are less fortunate, so that these effects balanced out at a young age? 

Teach children not think “Bob never makes any effort so why should I make effort with him” or even “Bob is boring, I don’t want to play with him”. Instead we should teach them to think “Bob is quiet, maybe he needs someone to play with”. This could then have a huge impact on Bobs life as he develops his social skills and confidence more and since these traits are compounding, becomes a much happier person that he otherwise would be",2020-05-20 09:28:42,changemyview
CMV: Anyone who feels insulted when they're told they have privilege is an idiot,"I would like to have empathy for my fellow humans but I just can't imagine being in a position where you're told you do not and will not experience hardship X and your first reaction is... defensiveness? It just does not make sense.

Bonus points for white feminists who don't understand racial privilege. Like. You understand sexism, presumably. You experience it. You have probably thought about the ways it effects your life and the ways it does not effect a man's life. I'm sure you understand that a man who has never been catcalled probably doesn't have anything new or relevant to say in a conversation about catcalling. Why can't you apply those exact same concepts to race?

Cis white males I can sort of understand, but this conversation about privilege has been going on so long. You'd think that anyone who is bothered by the concept of having privilege would take the two seconds to Google what it actually means before devoting so much of their energy into being offended. offended over the fact that... some people experience the world differently than they do???

"CMV: men are often preferred and hired because they are the better candidates, not because of sexism","Important : I am not saying this happens 100% of the time. But most of the time it does.

We live in a capitalist society. Companies hire the person who shows that will be the best at a certain position. In another post a guy mentioned how 95% of the CEOs in America are men. But is it because of sexism?

First of all, how many women applied for said positions? Or was it only men who wanted to be a CEO of a certain company? The same goes for other fields as well. Were mainly men hired because of sexism or because there were mainly men who applied for certain positions?

Second of all, qualifications. How many women actually have the knowledge and experience to run a company? There are some female CEOs, so it's possible for that to happen. But how many women decide to study economics, business management, marketing, finances etc. How many of those women are actually good at these fields? 

Lastly, people tend to forget how capitalism works. Companies hire the best suited candidate. Let's say that company X needs a new sales director. There are two candidates - Billy who graduated from a local community College with average grades and Marta who graduated from Harvard on top of her class. Of course a company will risk hiring the under qualified Billy who is more likely to fail at doing his job and will cost the company thousands, if not millions of dollars, because WoMin SyCk, YAy SeXsM Am I rIGht? Do you really think a company will skip hiring a qualified person just because of their gender? If this was true, said women would have gone to another company or country and started work there. Everything is based on your skills, abilities and experience. If you only get hired because of your gender you probably won't last long.",2020-05-20 05:26:42,changemyview
CMV: Role theory doesn't make much sense; therefore the theory of gender roles doesn't either,"When I have read about Role theory, I finally understood what the whole 'gender' idea is about. However, at the same time it seems to me that the whole Role theory doesn't make much sense to me  and therefore, by extension, the gender role theory doesn't make sense either. It seems to me either too trivial or plainly false.

There are 2 rules that I quite like that I would like to use here:

* If you can assert something without evidence, you can reject it without evidence.
* Not only it is not right; it's not even wrong. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not\_even\_wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong)

According to wikipedia: **Role theory** is a perspective in sociology and in social psychology that considers most of everyday activity to be the acting out of socially defined categories (e.g., mother, manager, teacher).

The non-controversial statement would be that if an extraterrestrial looked at what happens on Earth, he would find out that people *statistically* tend not to behave chaotically, but they do behave according to certain patterns. But as far as I understand, that's not what Role theory is about, is it?

The airplane pilots would try to steer the plane in a way it doesn't crash. Pedestrians would tend to look around in order not to be hit by a car. So you could say those people are fulfilling their role as a pedestrian, but... that doesn't make much sense. The counterclaim would be that the definition says it's perspective in sociology, while these people are trying not to die themselves. 

Better example: an orchestra; at first it seems that the people do have clearly definied 'roles'. However, if you want to do the orchestral music, there are not many ways to achieve that goal. The proven one ended up to be playing with a conductor, but certainly it's not the only one - only the others proved to be harder.  But that's the same with the airline pilot - unless he steers the plane in a way not to crash, he wouldn't achieve his goal. In order to achieve orchestral music, you have to *cooperate*. An external observer would certainly call it 'fulfilling a role'; but *cooperation* seems to me much better description. So, ultimately, is the orchestra *not* a good example of Role theory - rather a good example of cooperation?

There are *some* people who actually do take it as an imperative to fulfill their role (the famous 'it's my job, I have to do it' line) and expect it from others. And there certainly is - to a certain extent - a phenomena called 'corporate culture' ([https://betterlifecoachingblog.com/2010/12/06/the-monkey-experiment-a-story-about-company-culture/](https://betterlifecoachingblog.com/2010/12/06/the-monkey-experiment-a-story-about-company-culture/)). Is this what Role theory is about?

Mostly, what clicks here the most for me is the 'it's not even wrong' argument. I'll make the claim: The Role theory is *true*. How would you go to falsify that statement?",2020-05-20 04:54:09,changemyview
CMV: Women in the U.S. have more power than fourth wave feminists are willing to admit.,"What I mean by the title of the post is that women (as a bloc), at least in the U.S., have way more social power than they are willing to admit. I'll use the prohibition movement as an example. You may not have seen the photograph of the women with signs saying ""lips that touch alcohol shall not touch ours"", but women were very much behind the prohibition movement, and it got done with their support.

Women have way more ""soft power"" when they use sex as a weapon to get their way, and it's been shown to work. Women don't want Trump in office? Tell your conservative/bernie bro BF or husband you'll never have sex again if they vote for Trump. You don't really lose anything from doing this since divorce laws ensure you will either get alimony or child support.

You can use whatever insult you want, but I honestly don't have any ill will toward a woman for using her God-given attributes to get their way (I would too if I had that luxury), and I also don't care if you insult me. If it's possible to prove me wrong I'd like to see it though as this is a tiring view to hold.",2020-05-20 04:41:40,changemyview
